The selfishness of humans is a central assumption of orthodox (传统的) economics, where it is thought to lead to benefits for the economy a whole. It is what the 18th-century Scottish economist Adam Smith described as the "invisible hand". But evolutionary biologists have come to see cooperation and selflessness as a big part of our (31)      as a species. During the course of our evolution, they point out, cooperative groups (32)      outcompeted groups of cheats.

So we are inherently cooperative when operating within our own groups. We have also (33)      social mechanisms to reinforce actions that benefit the group. "You could say teamwork at the scale of small groups is the signature (34)      of our species," says evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson from Binghamton University in New York.

But (35)      teamwork can include a competition mechanism to promote actions that benefit the group, particularly in larger groups. It's also important to remember that in-group cooperation evolved partly in response to competition between groups.

This evolutionary perspective is radically new to economics, and it could be relevant to grand-scale economic problems that require solutions involving cooperation between nations. Take the challenge of getting nations to work together over economic solutions to climate change - a (36)      focus in the run-up to climate negotiations in Paris, France, later this year. This is a gargantuan（巨大的）problem from any perspective, but it is (37)      an issue of coordination for the sake of the common good at a massive scale, says Wilson. "The challenge is therefore to (38)      at larger scales the coordination and control that takes place more spontaneously at smaller scales," he says-from multicellular（多细胞的）organisms to village-sized groups of humans.
"Morality evolved out of cooperation within and competition between groups, so when acting as a single group to tackle global problems we will have to (39)      the role of natural selection ourselves," Wilson says. This might involve pursuing a wide variety of (40)      , identifying those that work best, and then creating incentives to cooperate on implementation. "In some ways it's the opposite of the invisible hand."

## PART V READING COMPREHENSION

[35MIN]

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are three passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each question, there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) Do you realize that every time you take a step, the bones in your hip are subjected to forces between four and five times your body weight? When you are running, this force is increased further still. What happens if through disease a hip-joint ceases to be able to resist such forces? For many years hip-joints and other body joints have been replaceable either partially or completely. It is after all a simple ball and socket joint; it has certain loads imposed on it; it needs reliability over a defined life; it must contain materials suitable for the working environment. Any engineer will recognize these as characteristic of a typical engineering problem, which doctors and engineers have worked together to solve, in order to bring a fresh lease of life to people who would otherwise be disabled.

(2) This typifies the way in which engineers work to help people and create a better quality of life. The fact that this country has the most efficient agricultural industry in the world is another good example. Mechanical engineers have worked with farmers and biologists to produce fertilizers, machinery and harvesting systems. This team effort has now produced crops uniformly waist high or less so that they are better suited to mechanical harvesting. Similar advances with other crops have released people from hard and boring jobs for more creative work, whilst machines harvest crops more efficiently with less waste. Providing more food for the rapidly increasing population is yet another role for the mechanical engineer.

41. According to the passage, when would most weight be imposed on hip-joints?
[A] When one is walking.
[B] When one is running.
[C] When one is standing.
[D] When one is lying down.
42. Engineers regard the replacement of hip-joints as a(n)      Problem.
[A] mechanical
[B] medical
[C] health
[D] agricultural
43. According to the passage, how do engineers contribute to increasing efficiency of the agricultural industry?
[A] By working with farmers.
[B] By working in teams.
[C] By growing crops of the same height.
[D] By making agricultural machinery.

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) Nowadays, a cellphone service is available to everyone, everywhere. Probably thousands of people have already been using it, but I just discovered it, so I'm going to claim it and also name it: Fake Foning.
(2) The technology has been working well for me at the office, but there are infinite applications. Virtually in any public space.
(3) Say you work at a big university with lots of talky faculty members buzzing about. Now, say you need to use the restroom. The trip down the hall will take approximately one hour, because a person can't walk into those talky people without getting pulled aside for a question, a bit of gossip, a new read on a certain line of Paradise Lost.
(4) So, a cellphone. Any cellphone. Just pick it up. Don't dial. Just hold that phone to your face and start talking. Walk confidently down the hall engaged in fake conversation, making sure to tailor both the topic and content to the person standing before you whom you are trying to evade.
(5) For standard colleague avoidance, I suggest fake chatting about fake business:
(6) "Yes, I'm glad you called, because we really need to hammer out the details. What's that? Yes, I read Page 12, but if you look at the bottom of 4, I think you can see the problem begins right there."
(7) Be animated. Be engaged in your fake fone conversation. Make eye contact with the people passing, nod to them, gesture keen interest in talking to them at a later time, point to your phone, shrug and move on.
(8) Shoppers should consider fake foning anytime they spot a talky neighbor in the produce department pinching (用手捏) unripe peaches. Without your phone at your face, you'd be in for a 20-minute speech on how terrible the world is.
(9) One important caution about fake foning. The other day I was fake foning my way past a colleague, and he was actually following me to get my attention. I knew he wanted to ask about a project I had not yet finished. I was trying to buy myself some time, so I continued fake foning with my doctor. "So I don't need the operation? Oh, doctor, that is the best news."
(10) And then: Brrrrrmg! Brrrrrmg! Brrrrrmg! My phone started ringing, right there while it was planted on my face. My colleague looked at me, and I at him, and naturally I gasped. "What is the matter with this thing?" I said, pulling the phone away to look at it, and then putting it back to my ear.
(11) "Hello? Are you still there?"
(12) Oops.

44. Which of the following statements is INCORRECT?
[A] Cellphone service is popular among people.
[B] Cellphone has much use in office.
[C] Fake foning is a new cellphone service.
[D] Fake foning is a new discovery.
45. In the author's opinion, in order to make fake foning look real one has to      .
[A] talk about interesting matters
[B] behave politely to people passing by
[C] hold the phone while walking
[D] appear absorbed in conversation
46. After his phone suddenly began ringing, the author      .
[A] immediately started talking to the caller
[B] immediately started talking to his colleague
[C] put the phone away and stopped talking
[D] continued with his fake conversation

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) It was late in the afternoon, and I was putting the final touch on a piece of writing that I was feeling pretty good about. I wanted to save it, but my cursor had frozen. I tried to shut the computer down, and it seized up altogether. Unsure of what else to do, I yanked (用力猛拉) the battery out.
(2) Unfortunately, Windows had been in the midst of a delicate and crucial undertaking. The next morning, when I turned my computer back on, it informed me that a file had been corrupted and Windows would not load. Then, it offered to repair itself by using the Windows Setup CD.
(3) I opened the special drawer where I keep CDs. But no Windows CD in there. I was forced to call the computer company's Global Support Centre. My call was answered by a woman in some unnamed, far-off land. I find it annoying to make small talk with someone when I don't know what continent they're standing on. Suppose I were to comment on the beautiful weather we've been having when there was a monsoon at the other end of the phone? So I got right to the point.
(4) "My computer is telling me a file is corrupted and it wants to fix itself, but I don't have the Windows Setup CD."
(5) "So you're having a problem with your Windows Setup CD." She has apparently been dozing and, having come to just as the sentence ended, was attempting to cover for her inattention.
(6) It quickly became clear that the woman was not a computer technician. Her job was to serve as a gatekeeper, a human shield for the technicians. Her sole duty, as far as I could tell, was to raise global stress levels.
(7) To make me disappear, the woman gave me the phone number for Windows' creator, Microsoft. This is like giving someone the phone number for, I don't know, North America. Besides, the CD worked; I just didn't have it. No matter how many times I repeated my story, we came back to the same place. She was calm and resolutely polite.
(8) When my voice hit a certain decibel (分贝), I was passed along, like a hot, irritable potato, to a technician.
(9) "You don't have the Windows Setup CD, ma'am, because you don't need it," he explained cheerfully. "Windows came preinstalled on your computer!"
(10) "But I do need it."
(11) "Yes, but you don't have it." We went on like this for a while. Finally, he offered to walk me through the use of a different CD, one that would erase my entire system. "Of course, you'd lose all your e-mail, your documents, your photos." It was like offering to drop a safe on my head to cure my headache. "You might be able to recover them, but it would be expensive." He sounded delighted. "And it's not covered by the warranty (产品保证书)!" The safe began to seem like a good idea, provided it was full.
(12) I hung up the phone and drove my computer to a small, friendly repair place I'd heard about. A smart, helpful man dug out a Windows CD and told me it wouldn't be a problem. An hour later, he called to let me know it was ready. I thanked him, and we chatted about the weather, which was the same outside my window as it was outside his.

47. Which of the following is the author's opinion about the woman at the Global Support Centre?
[A] She sounded helpful and knowledgeable.
[B] She was there to make callers frustrated.
[C] She was able to solve her computer problem.
[D] She was quick to pass her along to a technician.
48. According to the passage, the solution offered by the technician was      .
[A] effective
[B] economical
[C] unpractical
[D] unacceptable

#### PASSAGE FOUR

(1) Not long ago, a mysterious Christmas card dropped through our mail slot. The envelope was addressed to a man named Raoul, who, I was relatively certain, did not live with us. The envelope wasn't sealed, so I opened it. The inside of the card was blank. Ed, my husband, explained that the card was both from and to the newspaper deliveryman. His name was apparently Raoul, and Raoul wanted a holiday tip. We were meant to put a check inside the card and then drop the envelope in the mail. When your services are rendered at 4 a.m., you can't simply hang around, like a hotel bellboy expecting a tip. You have to be direct.
(2) So I wrote a nice holiday greeting to this man who, in my imagination, fires The New York Times from his bike aimed at our front door, causing more noise with mere newsprint than most people manage with sophisticated black market fireworks.
(3) With a start, I realized that perhaps the reason for the 4 a.m. wake-up noise was not ordinary rudeness but carefully executed spite: I had not tipped Raoul in Christmases past. I honestly hadn't realized I was supposed to. This was the first time he'd used the card tactic. So I got out my checkbook. Somewhere along the line, holiday tipping went from an optional thank-you for a year of services to a Mafia-style protection racket (收取保护费的黑社会组织)。
(4) Several days later, I was bringing our garbage bins back from the curb when I noticed an envelope taped to one of the lids. The outside of the envelope said MICKEY. It had to be another tip request, this time from our garbage collector. Unlike Raoul, Mickey hadn't enclosed his own Christmas card from me. In a way, I appreciated the directness. "I know you don't care how merry my Christmas is, and that's fine," the gesture said. "I want \         30, or I'll 'forget' to empty your garbage bin some hot summer day."
(5) I put a check in the envelope and taped it back to the bin. The next morning, Ed noticed that the envelope was gone, though the trash hadn't yet been picked up: "Someone stole Mickey's tip!" Ed was quite certain. He made me call the bank and cancel the check.
(6) But Ed had been wrong. Two weeks later, Mickey left a letter from the bank on our steps. The letter informed Mickey that the check, which he had tried to cash, had been cancelled. The following Tuesday morning, when Ed saw a truck outside, he ran out with his wallet. "Are you Mickey?"
(7) The man looked at him with scorn. "Mickey is the garbageman. I am the recycling." Not only had Ed insulted this man by hinting that he was a garbageman, but he had obviously neglected to tip him. Ed ran back inside for more funds. Then he noticed that the driver of the truck had been watching the whole transaction. He peeled off another twenty and looked around, waving bills in the air. "Anyone else?"
(8) Had we consulted the website of the Emily Post Institute, this embarrassing breach of etiquette (礼节) could have been avoided. Under "trash/recycling collectors" in the institute's Holiday Tipping Guidelines, it says: "\         10 to           30          each." You may or may not wish to know that your pet groomer, hairdresser, mailman and UPS guy all expect a holiday tip.

49. From the passage, we learn that the author      .
[A] didn't like Raoul's way of delivering the paper
[B] didn't realize why Raoul delivered the paper that way
[C] didn't know that Raoul came very early in the morning
[D] didn't feel it necessary to meet Raoul when he came
50. Ed's encounter with the recycling team shows that      .
[A] Ed was desperate to correct his mistake
[B] Ed only wanted to give money to Raoul
[C] Ed was unwilling to tip the truck driver
[D] Ed no longer wanted to give them money

Until recently, the medical community believed that most hearing loss was caused by hear cells in the ear degrading as we age. But evidence is emerging that sound levels at sporting events, concerts, nightclubs and on personal devices can cause lasting damage to the connections between hear cells in the ear and the nerves that (31)           sounds to the brain. Over 1.1 billion teenagers and young adults worldwide could be at risk of hearing loss as a result of (32)           to unsafe levels of recreational noise, according to a recent World Health Organization report. To make matters worse, this kind of hearing loss doesn't show up on (33)           tests. Researchers are calling it a hidden epidemic. "We think this problem is (34)           prevalent, but it's difficult to measure because the tools we have available today are not sensitive enough," says Konstantina Stankovic, an auditory neuroscientist and surgeon at Massachusetts Eye and Ear, and Harvard Medical School, in Boston.

Stankovic is now working with colleagues at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne to develop imaging (35)           that would allow us to see this kind of neural damage in living brains. This could help with early diagnosis. Others are developing drugs that could help (36)           the connections between the ear and the brain.

To properly (37)           our ears, loud noises should be banned in many public places just as smoking is now, says Stankovic. Some countries have laws in place to protect (38)           in bars and clubs by monitoring noise levels. Last year, Minneapolis City Council made it (39)           for bars and clubs to offer free earbuds to patrons. Stankovic thinks more will need to be done to change (40)           accepted norms around recreational noise. "I think it will require a public health effort similar to the efforts for limiting smoking, because of the peer pressure associated with loud music and noisy environments," she says.

## PART V READING COMPREHENSION

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are three passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each question, there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) What is the nature of the scientific attitude, the attitude of the man or woman who studies and applies physics, biology, chemistry, geology, engineering, medicine or any other science?
(2) We all know that science plays an important role in the societies in which we live. Many people believe, however, that our progress depends on two different aspects of science. The first of these is the application of the machines, products and systems of applied knowledge that scientists and technologists develop. Through technology, science improves the structure of society and helps man to gain increasing control over his environment.
(3) The second aspect is the application by all members of society of the special methods of thought and action that scientists use in their work.
(4) What are these special methods of thinking and acting? First of all, it seems that a successful scientist is full of curiosity - he wants to find out how and why the universe works. He usually directs his attention towards problems which he notices have no satisfactory explanation, and his curiosity makes him look for underlying relationships even if the data available seem to be unconnected. Moreover, he thinks he can improve the existing conditions and enjoys trying to solve the problems which this involves.
(5) He is a good observer, accurate, patient and objective and applies logical thought to the observations he makes. He utilizes the facts he observes to the fullest extent. For example, trained observers obtain a very large amount of information about a star mainly from the accurate analysis of the simple lines that appear in a spectrum.
(6) He is skeptical - he does not accept statements which are not based on the most complete evidence available - and therefore rejects authority as the sole basis for truth. Scientists always check statements and make experiments carefully and objectively to verify them.
(7) Furthermore, he is not only critical of the work of others, but also of his own, since he knows that man is the least reliable of scientific instruments and that a number of factors tend to disturb objective investigation.
(8) Lastly, he is highly imaginative since he often has to look for relationships in data which are not only complex but also frequently incomplete. Furthermore, he needs imagination if he wants to make hypotheses of how processes work and how events take place.
(9) These seem to be some of the ways in which a successful scientist or technologist thinks and acts.

41. Many people believe that science helps society to progress through           .
[A] applied knowledge
[B] more than one aspect
[C] technology only
[D] the use of machines
42. Which of the following statements is INCORRECT about curiosity?
[A] It gives the scientist confidence and pleasure in work.
[B] It gives rise to interest in problems that are unexplained.
[C] It leads to efforts to investigate potential connections.
[D] It encourages the scientist to look for new ways of acting.
43. According to the passage, a successful scientist would not           .
[A] easily believe in unchecked statements
[B] easily criticize others' research work
[C] always use his imagination in work
[D] always use evidence from observation

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) Over the past several decades, the U.S., Canada, and Europe have received a great deal of media and even research attention over unusual phenomena and unsolved mysteries. These include UFOs as well as sightings and encounters with "nonhuman creatures" such as Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster. Only recently has Latin America begun to receive some attention as well. Although the mysteries of the Aztec, Mayan, and Inca civilizations have been known for centuries, now the public is also becoming aware of unusual, paranormal phenomena in countries such as Peru.
(2) The Nazca "lines" of Peru were discovered in the 1930s. These lines are deeply carved into a flat, stony plain, and form about 300 intricate pictures of animals such as birds, a monkey, and a lizard. Seen at ground level, the designs are a jumbled senseless mess. The images are so large that they can only be viewed at a height of 1,000 feet - meaning from an aircraft. Yet there were no aircraft in 300 B.C., when it is judged the designs were made. Nor were there then, or are there now, any nearby mountain ranges from which to view them. So how and why did the native people of Nazca create these marvelous designs? One answer appeared in 1969, when the German researcher and writer Erich von Daniken proposed that the lines were drawn by extraterrestrials as runways for their aircraft. The scientific community did not take long to scoff at and abandon von Daniken's theory. Over the years several other theories have been put forth, but none has been accepted by the scientific community.
(3) Today there is a new and heightened interest in the Nazca lines. It is a direct result of the creation of the Internet. Currently there are over 60 sites dedicated to this mystery from Latin America's past, and even respected scientists have joined the discussion through e-mail and chat rooms.
(4) Will the Internet help explain these unsolved mysteries? Perhaps it is a step in the right direction.

44. Which of the following statements is INCORRECT?
[A] Latin America has long received attention for unusual phenomena.
[B] Public attention is now directed towards countries like Peru.
[C] Public interest usually focuses on North America and Europe.
[D] Some ancient civilizations have unsolved mysteries.
45. According to the passage, the Nazca lines were found           .
[A] in mountains
[B] in stones
[C] on animals
[D] on a plain
46. We can infer from the passage that the higher the lines are seen, the           the images they present.
[A] smaller
[B] larger
[C] clearer
[D] brighter

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) Graduation speeches are a bit like wedding toasts. A few are memorable. The rest tend to trigger such thoughts as, "Why did I wear such uncomfortable shoes?"
(2) But graduation speeches are less about the message than the messenger. Every year a few colleges and universities in the U.S. attract attention because they've managed to book high-profile speakers. And, every year, the media report some of these speakers' wise remarks.
(3) Last month, the following words of wisdom were spread:
(4) "You really haven't completed the circle of success unless you can help somebody else move forward." (Oprah Winfrey, Duke University).
(5) "There is no way to stop change; change will come. Go out and give us a future worthy of the world we all wish to create together." (Hillary Clinton, New York University).
(6) "This really is your moment. History is yours to bend." (Joe Biden, Wake Forest University).
(7) Of course, the real "get" of the graduation season was first lady Michelle Obama's appearance at the University of California, Merced. "Remember that you are blessed," she told the class of 2009, "Remember that in exchange for those blessings, you must give something back... As advocate and activist Marian Wright Edelman says, 'Service is the rent we pay for living ... it is the true measure, the only measure of success',"
(8) Calls to service have a long, rich tradition in these speeches. However, it is possible for a graduation speech to go beyond cliche and say something truly compelling. The late writer David Foster Wallace's 2005 graduation speech at Kenyon College in Ohio talked about how to truly care about other people. It gained something of a cult after it was widely circulated on the Internet. Apple Computer CEO Steve Jobs' address at Stanford University that year, in which he talked about death, is also considered one of the best in recent memory.
(9) But when you're sitting in the hot sun, fidgety and freaked out, do you really want to be lectured about the big stuff? Isn't that like trying to maintain a smile at your wedding reception while some relative gives a toast that amounts to "marriage is hard work"? You know he's right; you just don't want to think about it at that particular moment. In fact, as is the case in many major life moments, you can't really manage to think beyond the blisters your new shoes are causing.
(10) That may seem anticlimactic. But it also gets to the heart of one of life's greatest, saddest truths: that our most "memorable" occasions may elicit the fewest memories. It's probably not something most graduation speakers would say, but it's one of the first lessons of growing up.

47. The graduation speeches mentioned in the passage are related to the following themes EXCEPT           .
[A] death
[B] success
[C] service
[D] generosity
48. It is implied in the passage that at great moments people fail to           .
[A] remain clear-headed
[B] keep good manners
[C] remember others' words
[D] recollect specific details

#### PASSAGE FOUR

(1) Cultural rules determine every aspect of food consumption. Who eats together defines social units. For example, in some societies, the nuclear family is the unit that regularly eats together. The anthropologist Mary Douglas has pointed out that, for the English, the kind of meal and the kind of food that is served relate to the kinds of social links between people who are eating together. She distinguishes between regular meals, Sunday meals when relatives may come, and cocktail parties for acquaintances. The food served symbolizes the occasion and reflects who is present. For example, only snacks are served at a cocktail party. It would be inappropriate to serve a steak or hamburgers. The distinctions among cocktails, regular meals, and special dinners mark the social boundaries between those guests who are invited for drinks, those who are invited to dinner, and those who come to a family meal. In this example, the type of food symbolizes the category of guest and with whom it is eaten.
(2) In some New Guinea societies, the nuclear family is not the unit that eats together. The men take their meals in a men's house, separately from their wives and children. Women prepare and eat their food in their own houses and take the husband's portion to the men's house. The women eat with their children in their own houses. This pattern is also widespread among Near Eastern societies.
(3) Eating is a metaphor that is sometimes used to signify marriage. In many New Guinea societies, like that of the Lesu on the island of New Ireland in the Pacific and that of the Trobriand Islanders, marriage is symbolized by the couple's eating together for the first time. Eating symbolizes their new status as a married couple. In U.S. society, it is just the reverse. A couple may go out to dinner on a first date.
(4) Other cultural rules have to do with taboos against eating certain things. In some societies, members of a clan, a type of kin (family) group, are not allowed to eat the animal or bird that is their totemic ancestor. Since they believe themselves to be descended from that ancestor, it would be like eating that ancestor or eating themselves.
(5) There is also an association between food prohibitions and rank, which is found in its most extreme form in the caste system of India. A caste system consists of ranked groups, each with a different economic specialization. In India, there is an association between caste and the idea of pollution. Members of highly ranked groups can be polluted by coming into contact with the bodily secretions, particularly saliva, of individuals of lower-ranked castes. Because of the fear of pollution, Brahmans and other high-ranked individuals will not share food with, not eat from the same plate as, not even accept food from an individual from a low-ranking caste.

49. According to the passage, who will NOT eat together?
[A] The English.
[B] Americans on their first date.
[C] Men and women in Near Eastern societies.
[D] Newly-weds on the island of New Ireland.
50. According to the passage, eating together indicates all the following EXCEPT           .
[A] the type of food
[B] social relations
[C] marital status
[D] family ties

Friends who seem to post a photo of every meal they eat on Instagram or Twitter may not just be annoying; they may have a problem.

The trend of "foodstagramming" has bothered some restaurants to the point they have (31)           diners from snapping photos of their meals. But Dr. Valerie Taylor argues that (32)           documenting one's meals could be a signal of a larger dieting problem. "I see clients for whom food has become (33)           , and they struggle to go out and not have food be the key element of all social interaction: what they eat, when they ate, when they are going to eat again," Taylor said.

Taylor spoke at the Canadian Obesity Summit in Vancouver last week about eating (34)           and food's role in our culture. While Taylor admitted that sharing photos of food on social media is relatively common, she said that in some cases it can come at the (35)           of everything else. "The (36)           comes when all they do is send pictures of food. We take pictures of things that are important to us, and for some people, the food itself becomes (37)           and the rest - the venue, the company, etc - is background." While Taylor argues that producing such images may signal an unhealthy preoccupation with food, others have linked the (38)           of food photography to eating issues and weight gain.

Taylor isn't just focused on Instagram users. She (39)           in her speech that food tattoos send a similar warning sign. "I think for some people it (40)           how important food has become," Taylor said. "Just like the tattoos of 'I love McDonald's' replacing the 'I love Mom' tattoo, food is taking on a very important role. It has moved beyond simply fuel."

## PART V READING COMPREHENSION

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are three passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each multiple choice question, there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) We have a crisis on our hands. You mean global warning? The world economy? No, the decline of reading. People are just not doing it anymore, especially the young. Who's responsible? Actually, it's more like, what is responsible? The Internet, of course, and everything that comes with it - Facebook, Twitter (推特). You can write your own list.
(2) There's been a warning about the imminent death of literate civilization for a long time. In the 20th century, first it was the movies, then radio, then television that seemed to spell doom for the written world. None did. Reading survived; in fact it not only survived, it has flourished. The world is more literate than ever before - there are more and more readers, and more and more books.
(3) The fact that we often get our reading material online today is not something we should worry over. The electronic and digital revolution of the last two decades has arguably shown the way forward for reading and for writing. Take the arrival of e-book readers as an example. Devices like Kindle make reading more convenient and are a lot more environmentally friendly than the traditional paper book.
(4) As technology makes new ways of writing possible, new ways of reading are possible. Interconnectivity allows for the possibility of a reading experience that was barely imaginable before. Where traditional books had to make do with photographs and illustrations, an e-book can provide readers with an unlimited number of links: to texts, pictures, and videos. In the future, the way people write novels, history, and philosophy will resemble nothing seen in the past.
(5) On the other hand, there is the danger of trivialization. One Twitter group is offering its followers single-sentence-long "digests" of the great novels. War and Peace in a sentence? You must be joking. We should fear the fragmentation of reading. There is the danger that the high-speed connectivity of the Internet will reduce our attention span - that we will be incapable of reading anything of length or which requires deep concentration.
(6) In such a fast-changing world, in which reality seems to be remade each day, we need the ability to focus and understand what is happening to us. This has always been the function of literature and we should be careful not to let it disappear. Our society needs to be able to imagine the possibility of someone utterly in tune with modern technology but able to make sense of a dynamic, confusing world.
(7) In the 15th century, Johannes Guttenberg's invention of the printing press in Europe had a huge impact on civilization. Once upon a time the physical book was a challenging thing. We should remember this before we assume that technology is out to destroy traditional culture.

41. Which of the following paragraphs briefly reviews the historical challenges for reading?
[A] Paragraph One.
[B] Paragraph Two.
[C] Paragraph Three.
[D] Paragraph Four.
42. The following are all cited as advantages of e-books EXCEPT           .
[A] multimodal content
[B] environmental friendliness

[A] good judgment
[B] high sensitivity
[C] good imagination
[D] the ability to focus

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) I know when the snow melts and the first robins (知更鸟) come to call, when the laughter of children returns to the parks and playgrounds, something wonderful is about to happen.
(2) Spring cleaning.
(3) I'll admit spring cleaning is a difficult notion for modern families to grasp. Today's busy families hardly have time to load the dishwasher, much less clean the doormat. Asking the family to spend the weekend collecting winter dog piles from the melting snow in the backyard is like announcing there will be no more Wi-Fi. It interrupts the natural order.
(4) "Honey, what say we spend the weekend beating the rugs, sorting through the boxes in the basement and painting our bedroom a nice lemony yellow?" I say.
(5) "Can we at least wait until the NBA matches are over?" my husband answers.
(6) But I tell my family, spring cleaning can't wait. The temperature has risen just enough to melt snow but not enough for Little League practice to start. Some flowers are peeking out of the thawing ground, but there is no lawn to seed, nor garden to tend. Newly wakened from our winter's hibernation (冬眠), yet still needing extra blankets at night, we open our windows to the first fresh air floating on the breeze and all of the natural world demanding "Awake and be clean!"
(7) Biologists offer a theory about this primal impulse to clean out every drawer and closet in the house at spring's first light, which has to do with melatonin, the sleepytime hormone (激素) our bodies produce when it's dark. When spring's light comes, the melatonin diminishes, and suddenly we are awakened to the dusty, virus-filled house we've been hibernating in for four months.
(8) I tell my family about the science and psychology of a good healthy cleaning at spring's arrival. I speak to them about life's greatest rewards waiting in the removal of soap scum from the bathtub, which hasn't been properly cleaned since the first snowfall.
(9) "I'll do it," says the eldest child, a 21-year-old college student who lives at home.
(10) "You will? Wow!" I exclaim.
(11) Maybe after all these years, he's finally grasped the concept. Maybe he's expressing his rightful position as eldest child and role model. Or maybe he's going to Florida for a break in a couple of weeks and he's being nice to me who is the financial-aid officer.
(12) No matter. Seeing my adult son willingly cleaning that dirty bathtub gives me hope for the future of his 12-year-old brother who, instead of working, is found to be sleeping in the seat of the window he is supposed to be cleaning.
(13) "Awake and be clean!" I say.

44. According to the passage, "...spring cleaning is a difficult notion for modern families to grasp" means that spring cleaning           .
[A] is no longer an easy practice to understand.
[B] is no longer part of modern family life.
[C] requires more family members to be involved.
[D] calls for more complicated skills and knowledge.
45. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be included in family spring cleaning?
[A] Beating the rugs.
[B] Cleaning the window.
[C] Restoring Wi-Fi services.
[D] Cleaning the backyard.
46. Which of the following interpretations of the biologists' theory about melatonin is INCORRECT?
[A] The production of melatonin in our bodies varies at different times.
[B] Melatonin is more likely to cause sleepiness in our bodies.
[C] The reduction of melatonin will cause wakefulness in our bodies.
[D] The amount of melatonin remains constant in our bodies.

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) These days lots of young Japanese do omiai, literally, "meet and look." Many of them do so willingly. In today's prosperous and increasingly conservative Japan, the traditional omiai kekkon, or arranged marriage, is thriving.
(2) But there is a difference. In the original omiai, the young Japanese couldn't reject the partner chosen by his parents and their middleman. After World War II, many Japanese abandoned the arranged marriage as part of their rush to adopt the more democratic ways of their American conquerors. The Western ren'ai kekkon, or love marriage, became popular; Japanese began picking their own mates by dating and falling in love.
(3) But the Western way was often found wanting in an important respect: it didn't necessarily produce a partner of the right economic, social, and educational qualifications. "Today's young people are quite calculating," says Chieko Akiyama, a social commentator.
(4) What seems to be happening now is a repetition of a familiar process in the country's history, the "Japanization" of an adopted foreign practice. The Western ideal of marrying for love is accommodated in a new omiai in which both parties are free to reject the match. "Omiai is evolving into a sort of stylized introduction," Mrs. Akiyama says.
(5) Many young Japanese now date in their early twenties, but with no thought of marriage. When they reach the age - in the middle twenties for women, the late twenties for men - they increasingly turn to omiai. Some studies suggest that as many as          40%          of marriages each year are omiai kekkon. It's hard to be sure, say those who study the matter, because many Japanese couples, when polled, describe their marriage as a love match even if it was arranged.
(6) These days, doing omiai often means going to a computer matching service rather than to a nakodo. The nakodo of tradition was an old woman who knew all the kids in the neighbourhood and went around trying to pair them off by speaking to their parents; a successful match would bring her a wedding invitation and a gift of money. But Japanese today find it's less awkward to reject a proposed partner if the nakodo is a computer.
(7) Japan has about five hundred computer matching services. Some big companies, including Mitsubishi, run one for their employees. At a typical commercial service, an applicant pays           80          to           125          to have his or her personal data stored in the computer for two years and           200          or so more if a marriage results. The stored information includes some obvious items, like education and hobbies, and some not-so-obvious ones, like whether a person is the oldest child. (First sons, and to some extent first daughter, face an obligation of caring for elderly parents.)

47. According to the passage, today's young Japanese prefer           .
[A] a traditional arranged marriage
[B] a new type of arranged marriage
[C] a Western love marriage
[D] a more Westernized love marriage
48. One of the big differences between a traditional nakodo and its contemporary version lies in the way           .
[A] wedding gifts are presented
[B] a proposed partner is refused
[C] formalities are arranged
[D] the middleman/woman is chosen

#### PASSAGE FOUR

(1) Cordia Harrington was tired of standing up all day and smelling like French fries at night. She owned and operated three McDonald's shops in Illinois, but as a divorced mother of three boys, she yearned for a business that would provide for her children and let her spend more time with them.
(2) Her lucky moment came, strangely enough, after she was nominated in 1992 to be on the McDonald's bun committee. "The company picked me up in a corporate jet to see bakeries around the world," she recalls. "Every time I went to a meeting, I love it. This was global!"
(3) The experience opened her eyes to business possibilities. When McDonald's decided it wanted a new bun supplier, Harrington became determined to win the contract, even though she had no experience running a bakery.
(4) Harrington studied the bakery business and made sure she was never off executives' radar. "If you have a dream, you can't wait for people to call you," she says. "So I'd visit a mill and send them photos of myself in a baker's hat and jacket, holding a sign that say 'I want to be your baker.' " After four years and 32 interviews, her persistence paid off.
(5) Harrington sealed the deal with a handshake, sold her shops, and borrowed           13.5          million. She was ready to build the fastest, most automated bakery in the world.
(6) The Tennessee Bun Company opened ahead of schedule in 1997, in time for a slump in U.S. fast-food sales for McDonald's. Before Harrington knew it, she was down to her last           20,000         , not enough to cover payroll. And her agreement with McDonald's required that she sell exclusively to the company. "I cried myself to sleep many nights," she recalls. "I really did think, I am going to go bankrupt."
(7) But Harrington worked out an agreement to supply Pepperidge Farm as well. "McDonald's could see a benefit if our production went up and prices went down, and no benefit if we went out of business," she says. "That deal saved us."
(8) Over the next eight years, Harrington branched out even more: She started her own trucking business, added a cold-storage company, and now has three bakeries producing fresh buns and frozen dough - all now known as the Bun Companies. Speed is still a priority: It takes 11 people at the main bakery to turn out 60,000 buns an hour for clients across 40 states, South America, and the Caribbean.
(9) Grateful for the breaks she's had, Harrington is passionate about providing opportunities to all 230 employees. "Financial success is the most fun when you can give it away," she says.
(10) The current economy is challenging. Some of her clients' sales have declined, but she's found new clients and improved efficiencies to help sustain the company's double-digit growth.
(11) Cordia Harrington doesn't have to stand on her feet all day anymore. Two of her three sons now work for her. And she's remarried - her husband, Tom, is now her CFO.
(12) "This is more than a job," says Harrington. "It's a mission. I'm always thinking, how can we best serve our employees? If we support them, they'll do their best to look after our clients. That's how it works here."

49. According to the passage, which of the following was most significant in her early career?
[A] Her nomination on the McDonald's bun committee.
[B] Her travel and the visits to bakeries around the world.
[C] A business contract with local bun suppliers.
[D] The interviews and experience in running a bakery.
50. According to the passage, which of the following is fundamental to Harrington's success?
[A] Efficiency and love for the family.
[B] Perseverance and concern for employees.
[C] Business expansion and family support.
[D] Opportunities and speed.

## PART VI WRITING

Should students take a gap year to travel or work after finishing high school or go to university directly? This has been an intensely discussed question for years. The following are the supporters' and opponents' opinions. Read carefully the opinions from both sides and write your response in about 200 words, in which you should first summarize briefly the opinions from both sides and give your view on the issue.

Marks will be awarded for content relevance, content sufficiency, organization and language quality. Failure to follow the above instructions may result in a loss of marks.

| YES                                                          | NO                                                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spending one year travelling or working can broaden <br> students' horizons and enrich their knowledge to <br> understand the world better. It is a great opportunity for <br> them to gain exposure to a new environment and meet <br> different types of individuals with diverse backgrounds. <br> Sometimes they can even learn about the culture and <br> society of other peoples. | Parents are worried about students' safety when they <br> spend one year travelling or working. It is inevitable for <br> those young students to get into trouble of one kind or <br> another when taking a gap year. Besides, they are too <br> young to cope with emergencies well or protect <br> themselves from getting hurt, which might have a great <br> impact on their future development. |
| Taking a gap year will help students to accumulate <br> social experience. They cannot only enhance personal <br> capacities, but also associate themselves better with the <br> society. | It is not easy to implement this plan since not every <br> student can find a good job or afford his or her travel <br> after graduating from high school because of the global <br> economic downturn. |
| During the travel or work, students may have a clear <br> perspective of their own career development. It is not an <br> easy task for high-school graduates to make the right <br> choice about his or her major at university since high <br> school always emphasizes academic development. | Students may give up their academic development after <br> taking a gap year, which will have a negative effect on <br> their career. It is less likely for a graduate with only a <br> high-school degree to find an ideal job with high <br> income. |

Organised volunteering and work experience has long been a vital companion to university degree courses. Usually it is left to (31)           to deduce the potential from a list of extracurricular adventures on a graduate's resume, but now the University of Bristol has launched an award to formalise the achievements of students who devote time to activities outside their courses. Bristol PLuS aims to boost students in an increasingly competitive job market by helping them acquire work and life skills alongside (32)           qualifications.

"Our students are a pretty active bunch, but we found that they didn't (33)           appreciate the value of what they did outside the lecture hall," says Jeff Goodman, director of careers and employability at the university. "Employers are much more demanding than they used to be. They used to look for potential and saw it as part of their job to (34)           the value of an applicant's skills. Now they want students to be able to explain why those skills are (35)           to the job."

Students who sign up for the award will be expected to complete 50 hours of work experience or voluntary work, attend four workshops on employability skills, take part in an intensive skills-related activity and, crucially, write a summary of the skills they have gained. (36)           efforts will gain an Outstanding Achievement Award. Those who (37)           best on the sports field can take the Sporting PLuS Award which fosters employer-friendly sports accomplishments.

The experience does not have to be formally organised. "We're not just interested in easily identifiable skills," says Goodman. "For instance, one student took the lead in dealing with a difficult landlord and so (38)           negotiation skills. We try to make the experience have something to do with the individual lives."

Goodman hopes the (39)           will enable active students to fill in any gaps in their experience and encourage their less-active (40)           to take up activities outside their academic area of work.

## PART V READING COMPREHENSION

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are three passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each question, there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) Saying "thank you" is probably the first thing most of us learn to do in a foreign language. After all, we're brought up to be polite, and it is important to make a good impression upon other people—especially across national divides.
(2) So, what exactly are you supposed to say when "thank you" is only the 20th most popular way to express gratitude? According to a recent survey, 19 other ways of expressing appreciation finished ahead of "thank you" in a poll of 3,000 people.
(3) Pollsters found almost half of those asked preferred the more informal "cheers", while others liked to use such expressions as "ta", "great" and "nice one".
(4) So, just what is the appropriate form of words to express your thanks?
(5) Fortunately, the clue is in the language itself. "Cheers", despite its popularity, is considered an informal way to say thank you—and this is a definite clue as to when you can best use it.
(6) For instance, when going for a drink with friends, a smile and a "cheers" by way of thanks is not only appropriate to the situation, it is also culturally accurate.
(7) "Ta", originated from the Danish word "tak", was the second-most popular expression of thanks, and is also commonly used in informal situations, along with phrases such as "nice one", and "brilliant". Interestingly, one word that didn't make it into the top 20 was "thanks". Thank you's shorter, more informal cousin.
(8) "Thanks" can be useful, as it is able to bridge the divide between the formality of "thank you" and the downright relaxed "cheers".
(9) Certain words can double as an expression of thanks as well as delight. Again, the words themselves offer the clue as to when best to use them.
(10) For example, words like "awesome", "brilliant" and "you star" featured highly in the new poll and they can hint at both your pleasure at someone's action, as well as serving to express your thanks. If you are on the receiving end of a "new" thank you, you can respond with a simple "no problem", or "sure".
(11) Of course, in certain circumstances, a simple wave, nod or smile may be appropriate. For instance, if a car driver slows down to let you cross the road, simply raising your hand in acknowledgement is enough to show that you appreciate the driver's consideration.
(12) Sometimes, formality is necessary, and "thank you" is still the best choice in such situations. But students should not worry about when exactly to use certain expressions.
(13) Many people in Western countries are worried that good manners are in decline. People are tired of seeing their acts of kindness and service pass without comment. So don't think that your "thank you" was clumsy or awkwardly formal. The chances are, if you said "thank you", you made someone's day. You star.

41. We can tell from the results of the poll that           .
[A] people are unconcerned about politeness nowadays
[B] "thank you" remains the best expression of gratitude
[C] there is a variety of expressions of appreciation
[D] there are more formal expressions than informal ones
42. Which word/phrase does NOT appear in the top 20?
[A] Cheers.
[B] Thanks.
[C] Brilliant.
[D] You star.
43. According to the passage, the way in which we express our gratitude depends on all the following EXCEPT
[A] gender
[B] formality
[C] culture
[D] circumstance

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) From 2007 to 2010, American households lost  11  trillion in real estate, savings, and stocks. More than half of all U.S. workers either lost their jobs or were forced to take cuts in hours or pay during the recession. The worst may be behind them now, but the shocking losses of the past few years have reshaped nearly every facet of their lives—how they live, work, and spend—even the way they think about the future.
(2) For Cindy, the recession began when her husband was relocated to Rhinelander, Wisconsin, by his company, forcing the family to move in a hurry. The couple bought a new house but were unable to sell their two-bedroom home in Big Lake, Minnesota. With two mortgages and two young children to care for, Cindy couldn't imagine how to stretch her husband's paycheck to keep her family fed.
(3) Then she stumbled upon an online community called Blotanical, a forum for gardeners, many with an interest in sustainability. "The more I read and discussed these practices, the more I realized this would help not only our budget but also our health," she says.
(4) Cindy admits that before the recession, she was a city girl with no interest in growing her own dinner. "I grew flowers mostly—I didn't think about plants that weren't visually interesting." But to stretch her budget, she began putting in vegetables and fruit—everything from strawberry beds to apple trees—and as her first seedlings grew, her spirits lifted. She no longer thinks of gardening and making her own jams as just a money saver; they're a genuine pleasure. "It's brought us closer together as a family, too," she says. Her kids voluntarily pitch in with the garden work, and the family cooks together instead of eating out. The food tastes better—it's fresher and organic—and the garden handily fulfills its original purpose: cost cutting. Now she spends about  200  to  300  a month on groceries, less than half of the  650  a month that she used to lay out.
(5) After discovering how resourceful she can be in tough times, Cindy is no longer easily discouraged. "It makes me feel proud to be able to say I made it myself," she says. "I feel accomplished, and I'm more confident about attempting things I've never done before." Now she avoids convenience stores and has begun learning to knit, quilt, and make her own soap. "I don't think I would have ever begun this journey if it weren't for the recession," she says. "I have a feeling that from now on, it will affect my family's health and happiness for the better."

44. We learn from the first paragraph that the recession           .
[A] affected Americans in certain occupations
[B] had great impact on Americans' work and life
[C] had only brought huge losses in savings and stocks
[D] is over with some of the losses recovered
45. Which of the following statements is CORRECT?
[A] Cindy had seen the benefits of gardening in a different way.
[B] Cindy had developed a hobby of gardening before the recession.
[C] Cindy had already had a keen interest in sustainability.
[D] Cindy had already planned to meet the gardeners.
46. In addition, Cindy views gardening as a genuine pleasure because gardening           .
[A] helped her cut living costs almost by half
[B] enabled her to make her own jams
[C] built up family ties and kids' enthusiasm
[D] enabled her to know more about plants

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) "I'm a little worried about my future," said Dustin Hoffman in The Graduate. He should be so lucky. All he had to worry about was whether to have an affair with Mrs. Robinson. In the sixties, that was the sum total of post-graduation anxiety syndrome.
(2) Hoffman's modern counterparts are not so fortunate. The Mrs. Robinsons aren't sitting around at home any more, seducing graduates. They are out in the workplace, doing the high-powered jobs the graduates want, but cannot get. For those fresh out of university, desperate for work but unable to get it, there is a big imbalance between supply and demand. And there is no narrowing of the gap in sight.
(3) The latest unemployment figures show that 746,000 of 18-24 year-olds are unemployed—a record rate of 18 per cent. Many of those will have graduated this summer. They are not panicking yet, but as the job rejections mount up, they are beginning to feel alarmed.
(4) Of course, it is easy to blame the Government and, in particular, the target that Labour has long trumpeted—50 per cent of school-leavers in higher education. That was not too smart. The Government has not only failed to meet its target—the actual figure is still closer to 40 per cent—but it has raised expectations to unrealistic levels.
(5) Parents feel as badly let down as the young people themselves. Middle-class families see their graduate offspring on the dole queue and wonder why they bothered paying school fees. Working-class families feel an even keener sense of disappointment. For many such families, getting a child into university was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. It represented upward social and financial mobility. It was proof that they were living in a dynamic, economically successful country. That dream does not seem so rosy now.
(6) Graduate unemployment is not, ultimately, a political problem ready to be solved. Job-creation schemes for graduates are very low down in ministerial in-trays. If David Cameron's Conservatives had a brilliant idea for guaranteeing every graduate a well-paid job, they would have unveiled it by now. It is a social problem, though a more deep-seated social problem than people perhaps realize.

47. With regard to job opportunities for young graduates, the author sounds        .
[A] pessimistic
[B] hopeful
[C] indifferent
[D] furious
48. Which of the following statements about parents' feelings is CORRECT?
[A] Working-class parents feel just as disappointed.
[B] Parents and their children feel equally disappointed.
[C] Middle-class parents feel more disappointed.
[D] Parents feel more disappointed than their children.

#### PASSAGE FOUR

(1) No matter how many times you have seen images of the golden mask of boy king Tutankhamen, come face to face with it in Egypt's Cairo museum, and you will suck in your breath.
(2) It was on Nov 4, 1923, that British archaeologist Howard Carter stumbled on a stone at the base of the tomb of another pharaoh in Luxor that eventually led to a sealed doorway.
(3) Then, on Nov 23, Carter found a second door and when he stuck his head through it, what he saw was to stun the world. Inside lay the great stone coffin, enclosing three chests of gilded wood.
(4) A few months later, when a crane lifted its granite cover and one coffin after another was removed, Carter found a solid block of gold weighing 110 kg. In it was the mummy of the 19-year-old Tutankhamen, covered in gold with that splendid funeral mask. And all this lay buried for more than 3,000 years.
(5) Months after my trip to Egypt, I can relive the rush of emotion I felt and sense the hush that descended on the crammed Cairo museum's Tutankhamen gallery.
(6) Cairo, a dusty city of 20 million people, is a place where time seems to both stand still and rush into utter chaos. It is a place where the ancient and contemporary happily go along on parallel tracks.
(7) Take the Great Pyramids of Giza, sitting on the western edge of the city. Even as the setting sun silhouettes these gigantic structures against the great desert expanse, a call for prayer floats over semi-finished apartment blocks filled with the activity of city life.
(8) While careful planning for the afterlife may lie buried underground in Cairo, it is noise and confusion on the streets. Donkey carts battle for space with pedestrians and the only operative road rule is "might is right." But it is a city that is full of life—from the small roadside restaurants to the coffee shops where men and women smoke the shisha.
(9) Donkey carts piled high with flat-breads magically find their way in and out the maddening traffic; young women in long skirts and headscarves hold hands with young men in open collar shirts, while conversations dwell on Kuwait's chances at the soccer World Cup.

49. Which of the following statements about the discovery of the mummy is INCORRECT?
[A] The mummy was first discovered by a British archaeologist.
[B] The discovery of the mummy came as a surprise.
[C] The mummy was found lying right inside the stone coffin.
[D] The masked mummy was covered in gold.
50. Which pair of words/phrases indicates contrast?
[A] Gigantic structure: great desert expanse
[B] A call for prayer: men and women with the shisha
[C] Chaos: maddening
[D] Coffee shops: pyramids

## PART VI WRITING

Should museum entry be free? This has been an intensely discussed question for years. The following are the supporters' and opponents' opinions. Read carefully the opinions from both sides and write your response in about 200 words, in which you should first summarize briefly the opinions from both sides and give your view on the issue.

Marks will be awarded for content relevance, content sufficiency, organization and language quality. Failure to follow the above instructions may result in a loss of marks.

| YES                                                          | NO                                                           |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Museums preserve and display our artistic, social, <br> scientific and political heritage. Everyone should have <br> access to such important cultural resources, which offer <br> educational opportunities to people of every age. | Free entry could limit the development of museums. <br> Without the revenue from entry fees, museums would <br> not have enough money to collect and preserve cultural <br> objects and hold extra exhibitions of rare pieces. |
| Museums have a valuable role in preserving and <br> transmitting a nation's history and heritage to new <br> generations. Free access will encourage more people to <br> find out more about their country and help to promote <br> feelings of national unity and identity and greater <br> understanding and acceptance of foreign cultures. | If museums are to be funded entirely by public money, <br> the pressures on the government's other budgets, such as <br> the demands of hospitals, schools, pensions, etc., will <br> inevitably make museums an under-funding and poor <br> sector. This will not help our creative industries or <br> tourism. |
| Free access is an investment in the future of this sector <br> of the economy and therefore has long-term benefits in <br> securing prosperity for the whole society. | If museums are entirely funded by the government, they <br> will lack an incentive to increase the number of visitors <br> and to make their collections exciting and accessible for <br> all. |

A small bowl of porridge each day could be the key to a long and healthy life, after a major study by Harvard University found that whole grains reduce the risk of dying from heart disease.

Although whole grains are widely believed to be (31)   for health, it is the first research to look at whether they have a long-term impact on lifespan. Researchers (32)   more than 100,000 people for more than 14 years monitoring their diets health outcomes. Everyone involved in the study was healthy in 1984 when they enrolled, but when they were followed up in 2010 more than 26,000 had died. However, those who ate the most whole grains, such as porridge, brown rice and corn seemed protected from many illnesses and (33)   heart disease.

Oats are already the breakfast of (34)   for many athletes and also for dieters, who find the high fibre levels give them energy for a longer time. But scientists found that for each ounce (28g) of whole grains eaten a day - the (35)   of a small bowl of porridge - the risk of all death was reduced by 5 percent and heart deaths by 9 percent.
"These findings further support current dietary guidelines that (36)   increasing whole-grain consumption," said the lead author Dr. Hongyn Wu of Harvard School of Public Health. "They also provide (37)   evidence that suggests a diet enriched with whole grains may confer benefits towards (38)   life expectancy."

The findings remained even when (39)   for different ages, smoking, body mass index and physical activity. Whole grains are very popular in many dietary guidelines because they contain high levels of (40)   like zinc, copper, manganese (镍) and iron. They are also believed to boost levels of antioxidants (抗氧化物）which combat free-radicals.

## PART V READING COMPREHENSION

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are several passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each question, there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) The art of public speaking began in ancient Greece over 2,000 years ago. Now, twitter, instant messaging, e-mail, blogs and chat forums offer rival approaches to communication - but none can replace the role of a great speech.
(2) The spoken word can handle various vital functions: persuading or inspiring, informing, paying tribute, entertaining, or simply introducing someone or something or accepting something.
(3) Over the past year, the human voice has helped guide us over the ups and downs of what was certainly a stormy time.
(4) Persuasion is used in dealing with or reconciling different points of view. When the leaders met in Copenhagen in December 2009, persuasive words from activists encouraged them to commit themselves to firmer action.
(5) Inspirational speeches confront the emotions. They focus on topics and matters that are close to people's hearts. During wars, generals used inspiring speeches to prepare the troops for battle.
(6) A speech that conveys knowledge and enhances understanding can inform us. The information must be clear, accurate, and expressed in a meaningful and interesting way. When the H1N1 pandemic (流行病) was announced, the idea of "swine flu" (猪流感) scared many people. Informative speeches from World Health Organization officials helped people to keep their panic under control so they could take sensible precautions.
(7) Sad events are never easy to deal with but a speech that pays tribute to the loss of a loved one and gives praise for their contribution can be comforting. Madonna's speech about Michael Jackson, after his death, highlighted the fact that he will continue to live on through his music.
(8) It's not only in world forums where public speaking plays an important role. It can also be surprisingly helpful in the course of our own lives.
(9) If you're taking part in a debate you need to persuade the listeners of the soundness of your argument. In sports, athletes know the importance of a pep talk (鼓舞士气的讲话) before a match to inspire teammates. You yourself may be asked to do a presentation at college or work to inform the others about an area of vital importance.
(10) On a more personal level, a friend may be upset and need comforting. Or you might be asked to introduce a speaker at a family event or to speak at a wedding, where your language will be needed to move people or make them laugh.
(11) Great speaking ability is not something we're born with. Even Barack Obama works hard to perfect every speech. For a brilliant speech, there are rules that you can put to good use. To learn those rules you have to practice and learn from some outstanding speeches in the past.

41. Which of the following statements is INCORRECT about the role of public speaking?
[A] Speeches at world forums can lead to effective solutions to world problems.
[B] Speeches from medical authorities can calm people down in times of pandemics.
[C] The morale of soldiers before a battle can be boosted by senior officers' speeches.
[D] Speeches paying tribute to the dead can comfort the mourners.
42. Public speaking can play all the following roles EXCEPT   .
[A] to convince people in a debate
[B] to inform people at a presentation
[C] to advise people at work
[D] to entertain people at a wedding
43. What is the main idea of the passage?
[A] Public speaking in international forums.
[B] Public speaking in daily life context.
[C] The many uses of public speaking.
[D] The rules of public speaking.

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) Every business needs two things, says Skullcandy CEO Rick Alden: inspiration and desperation. In 2001, Alden had both. He'd sold two snowboarding businesses, and he was desperately bored. But he had an idea: He wanted to make a new kind of headphone.
(2) "I kept seeing people missing their cell phone calls because they were listening to music," he explains. "Then I'm in a chairlift (索道), I've got my headphones on, and I realize my phone is ringing. As I take my gloves off and reach for my phone, I think, 'It can't be that tough to make headphones with two plugs, one for music and one for your cell phone.'" Alden described what he wanted to a designer, perfected a prototype, and outsourced (外包) manufacturing overseas.
(3) Alden then started designing headphones into helmets, backpacks - anywhere that would make it easy to listen to music while snowboarding. "Selling into board and skate shops wasn't a big research effort," he explains. "Those were the only guys I knew!"
(4) Alden didn't want to be a manufacturer. And by outsourcing, he'd hoped he could get the business off the ground without debt. But he was wrong. So he asked his wife, "Can I put a mortgage (抵押贷款) on the house? She said, 'What is the worst thing that can happen? We lose the house, we sell our cars, and we start all over again.' I definitely married the right woman!"
(5) For the next two years, Alden juggled mortgage payments and payments to his manufacturers. "Factories won't ship your product till they get paid," he says. "But it takes four or five months to get a mortgage company so upset that they knock on your door. So we paid the factory first."
(6) Gradually, non-snowboarders began to notice the colorful headphones. In 2006, the company started selling them in 1,400 FYE (For Your Entertainment) stores. "We knew that nine out of ten people walking into that store would be learning about Skullcandy for the first time. Why would they look at brands they knew and take home a new brand instead? We had agreed to buy back anything we didn't sell, but we were dealing with huge numbers. It'd kill us to take back all the products."
(7) Alden's fears faded as Skullcandy became the No. 1 headphone seller in those stores and tripled its revenue to  \  120  million in one year. His key insight was that headphones weren't gadgets; they were a fashion accessory. "In the beginning," he says, "that little white wire that said you had an iPod - that was cool. But now wearing the white bud means you're just like everyone else. Headphones occupy this critical piece of cranial real estate and are highly visible."
(8) Today, Skullcandy is America's second-largest headphone supplier, after Sony. With 79 employees, the company is bigger than Alden ever imagined.

44. Alden came up with the idea of a new kind of headphone because he   .
[A] was no longer in snowboarding business
[B] had no other business opportunities
[C] saw an inconvenience among mobile users
[D] was very fond of modern music
45. What did Alden do to promote sales in FYE stores?
[A] He spent more money on product advertising.
[B] He agreed to sell products at a discount.
[C] He improved the color design of the product.
[D] He promised to buy back products not sold.
46. Alden sees headphones as   .
[A] a kind of device
[B] part of fashion
[C] a symbol of status
[D] a sign of self-confidence

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) I was standing in my kitchen wondering what to have for lunch when my friend Taj called.
(2) "Sit down," she said.
(3) I thought she was going to tell me she had just gotten the haircut from hell. I laughed and said, "It can't be that bad."
(4) But it was. Before the phone call, I had 30 years of retirement saving in a "safe" fund with a brilliant financial guru (金融大亨). When I put down the phone, my savings were gone. I felt as if I had died and, for some unknown reason, was still breathing.
(5) Since Bernie Madoff's arrest on charges of running a  \  65  million Ponzi scheme, I've read many articles about how we investors should have known what was going on. I wish I could say I had reservations about Madoff before "the Call", but I did not.
(6) On New Year's Eve, three weeks after we lost our savings, six of us Madoff people gathered at Taj's house for dinner. As we were sitting around the table, someone asked, "If you could have your money back right now, but it would mean giving up what you have learned by losing it, would you take the money or would you take what losing the money has given you?"
(7) My husband was still in financial shock. He said, "I just want the money back." I wasn't certain where I stood. I knew that losing our money had cracked me wide open. I'd been walking around like what the Buddhists call a hungry ghost: always focused on the bite that was yet to come, not the one in my mouth. No matter how much I ate or had or experienced, it didn't satisfy me, because I wasn't really taking it in, wasn't absorbing it. Now I was forced to pay attention. Still, I couldn't honestly say that if someone had offered me the money back, I would turn it down.
(8) But the other four all said that what they were seeing about themselves was incalculable, and they didn't think it would have become apparent without the ground of financial stability being ripped out from underneath them.
(9) My friend Michael said, "I'd started to get complacent. It's as if the muscles of my heart started to atrophy (萎缩). Now they're awake, alive—and I don't want to go back."
(10) These weren't just empty words. Michael and his wife needed to take in boarders to meet their expenses. Taj was so broke that she was moving into someone's garage apartment in three weeks. Three friends had declared bankruptcy and weren't sure where or how they were going to live.

47. How did the author feel in the following weeks?
[A] Desperate
[B] Indifferent.
[C] Disappointed.
[D] Angry.
48. Which of the following statements is CORRECT about her friends?
[A] Her friends felt the same as she did.
[B] Her friends valued their experience more.
[C] Her friends were in a better financial situation.
[D] Her friends were more optimistic than she.

#### PASSAGE FOUR

(1) In the 19th century, there used to be a model of how to be a good person. There are all these torrents of passion flowing through you. Your job, as captain of your soul, is to erect dams to keep these passions in check. Your job is to just say no to laziness, lust, greed, drug use and the other sins.
(2) These days that model is of fashion. You usually can't change your behaviour by simply resolving to do something. Knowing what to do is not the same as being able to do it. Your willpower is not like a dam that can block the torrent of self-indulgence. It's more like a muscle, which tires easily. Moreover, you're a social being. If everybody around you is overeating, you'll probably do so, too.
(3) The 19th-century character model was based on an understanding of free will. Today, we know that free will is bounded. People can change their lives, but ordering change is not simple because many things, even within ourselves, are beyond our direct control.
(4) Much of our behaviour, for example, is guided by unconscious habits. Researchers at Duke University calculated that more than 40 percent of the actions we take are governed by habit, not actual decisions. Researchers have also come to understand the structure of habits - cue, routine, reward.
(5) You can change your own personal habits. If you leave running shorts on the floor at night, that'll be cue to go running in the morning. Don't try to ignore your afternoon snack craving. Every time you feel the cue for a snack, insert another routine. Take a walk.
(6) Their research thus implies a different character model, which is supposed to manipulate the neural (神经系统) networks inside.
(7) To be an effective person, under this model, you are supposed to coolly examine your own unconscious habits, and the habits of those under your care. You are supposed to devise strategies to alter the cues and routines. Every relationship becomes slightly manipulative, including your relationship with yourself. You're trying to arouse certain responses by implanting certain cues.
(8) This is a bit disturbing, because the important habitual neural networks are not formed by mere routine, nor can they be reversed by clever cues. They are burned in by emotion and strengthened by strong yearnings, like the yearnings for admiration and righteousness.
(9) If you think you can change your life in a clever way, the way an advertiser can get you to buy an air freshener, you're probably wrong. As the Victorians understood, if you want to change your life, don't just look for a clever cue. Commit to some larger global belief.

49. The 19th-century does not work because   .
[A] it has worked unsatisfactorily most of the time
[B] the comparison of free will to a dam is groundless
[C] what one wishes to do should be considered carefully
[D] there were many other factors beyond one's control
50. We learn from the passage that the new character model   .
[A] has been used to change behaviour successfully
[B] deals better with emotional aspects of behaviour
[C] stresses the neural and psychological aspects of habit change
[D] can bring about changes in one's life like what advertisers do

About 2 million jobless Americans fear they'll lose their extended unemployment benefits, which are slated (计划) to end next month unless Congress votes to renew them. Their concerns make a new finding all the more (31)   : Many people eligible for unemployment don't even bother to collect it. In the depths of the (32)   in 2008 and 2009, only half of those who qualified for benefits (33)   , a study by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank shows.

The portion filing for benefits shot up to  95%  in 2010 and 2011, the study says, but that still means about 200,000 people didn't claim money to which they were (34)   .

Many unemployed people aren't eligible for benefits because they worked part-time or weren't at their jobs long enough, for example. In 2009, about 3 million of the average 14.5 million or so jobless people didn't qualify for benefits. But of the roughly 11.4 million who were laid off and eligible to collect that year, only about 5.7 million filed (35)   , according to Fuller and the BLS. Those who didn't saved state and federal governments  108  billion - (36)   as much as the   121  billion in benefits paid, the study says. That (37)   dwarfed the   11  billion in benefit overpayments due to clerical errors or fraud.

The share of people applying for benefits has risen or fallen along with average duration of unemployment. For example, Americans were out of work for an average joblessness (38)   of about 33 weeks in 2010 and 39 weeks in 2011 as the share seeking benefits soared to  95% .

Average jobless duration has (39)   near 40 weeks this year. But it should dip to about 37 weeks in 2013, says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. That suggests the portion seeking benefits could (40)   slightly.

## PART V READING COMPREHENSION

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are several passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each question, there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) After breakfast the boys wandered out into the playground. Here the day-boys were gradually assembling. They were sons of the local clergy, of the officers at the depot, and of such manufacturers or men of business as the old town possessed. Presently a bell rang, and they all trooped into school. This consisted of a large, long room at opposite ends of which two undermasters conducted the second and third forms, and of a smaller one, leading out of it, used by Mr. Watson, who taught the first form. To attach the preparatory to the senior school these three classes were known officially, on speech days and in reports, as upper, middle, and lower second. Philip was put in the last. The master, a red-faced man with a pleasant voice, was called Rice; he had a cheerful manner with boys, and the time passed quickly. Philip was surprised when it was a quarter to eleven and they were let out for ten minutes' rest.

(2) The whole school rushed noisily into the playground. The new boys were told to go into the middle, while the others stationed themselves along opposite walls. They began to play Pig in the Middle. The old boys ran from wall to wall while the new boys tried to catch them; when one was seized and the mystic words said - one, two, three, and a pig for me - he became a prisoner and, turning sides, helped to catch those who were still free. Philip saw a boy running past and tried to catch him but his limp gave him no chance; and the runners, taking their opportunity, made straight for the ground he covered. Then one of them had the brilliant idea of imitating Philip's clumsy run. Other boys saw it and began to laugh; then they all copied the first; and they ran round Philip, limping comically, screaming with shrill laughter. They lost their heads with the delight of their new amusement, and choked with helpless merriment. One of them tripped Philip up and he fell, heavily as he always fell, and cut his knee. They laughed all the louder when he got up. A boy pushed him from behind, and he would have fallen again if another had not caught him. The game was forgotten in the entertainment of Philip's deformity. Philip was completely scared. He could not make out why they were laughing at him. His heart beat so that he could hardly breathe, and he was more frightened than he had ever been in his life. He stood still stupidly while the boys ran round him, mimicking and laughing; they shouted to him to try and catch them; but he did not move. He did not want them to see him run any more. He was using all his strength to prevent himself from crying.

41. From the beginning of the passage we learn that  .
[A] the school had only three classes
[B] the school only accepted day-boys
[C] some pupils came from the local area
[D] Philip's class was part of the senior school
42. In the game Philip lost his ground because  .
[A] the game wasn't fit for new boys like him
[B] the playground wasn't big enough for the game
[C] he did not know the rules of the game
[D] he could not run as quickly as other boys
43. How did Philip feel in the end?
[A] He was ashamed of himself.
[B] He was very nervous.
[C] He was really horrified.
[D] He felt himself stupid.

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) For parents who send their kids off to college saying, "These will be the best years of your life," it would be very appropriate to add, "If you can handle the stress of college life."

(2) Freshmen are showing up already stressed out, according to the latest research study that reported students' emotional health levels at their lowest since the survey started in 1985. While in school, more students are working part-time and near-full-time jobs. At graduation, only 29 percent of seniors have jobs lined up.

(3) Pressure to excel often creates stress, and many students are not learning how to effectively handle this stress. Let me share five facts that I believe every college student should know about stress.

(4) First, stress can make smart people do stupid things. Stress causes what brain researchers call "cortical inhibition". In simple terms, stress hinders a part of the brain responsible for decision-making and reaction time and can adversely affect other mental abilities as well.

(5) Second, the human body doesn't discriminate between a big stressful event and a little one. Any stressful experience will create about 1,400 biochemical events in your body. If any amount of stress is left unchecked, many things can occur within the body, including premature aging, impaired cognitive function and energy drain.

(6) Third, stress can become your new pattern. When you regularly experience negative feelings and high amounts of stress, your brain recognizes this as your normal state. This then becomes the new pattern, or baseline for your emotional state.

(7) Fourth, stress can be controlled. Countless studies demonstrate that people can restructure their emotional state using emotion-refocusing techniques. These techniques help you recognize how you are feeling and shift to a more positive emotional, mental and physical state.

(8) One technique involves slowing your thoughts and focusing on your heartbeat, breathing slowly and deeply, and focusing on the positive feeling that you receive.

(9) Finally, stress can be lessened if you love what you study. Barbara Frederickson, a leading international authority on the importance of positive emotions, says humans are genetically programmed to seek positive emotions such as love and joy. It is suggested to choose a major or career path you love and enjoy. Otherwise, you could end up fighting against your own biology.

44. The author cites the latest research study in order to show that  .
[A] students are studying harder in college
[B] most students have part-time jobs now
[C] stress continues to the time of graduation
[D] students only feel stressed while in school
45. According to the passage, stress might cause all the following negative effects EXCEPT  .
[A] social
[B] mental
[C] emotional
[D] physical
46. According to the context, what does "your own biology" mean in the last paragraph?
[A] Your current major.
[B] Your preference.
[C] Your future research.
[D] Your future job.

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) For anyone who doubts that the texting revolution is upon us, consider this: The average 13-to 17-year-old sends and receives 3,339 texts a month - more than 100 per day, according to the Nielsen Co., the media research firm. Adults are catching up. People from age 45 to 54 sent and received 323 texts a month in the second quarter of 2010, up  75% from a year ago, Nielsen says.

(2) Behind the texting explosion is a fundamental shift in how we view our mobile devices. That they are phones is increasingly beside the point.

(3) Part of what's driving the texting surge among adults is the popularity of social media. Sites like Twitter, with postings of no more than 140 characters, are creating and reinforcing the habit of communicating in micro-bursts.

(4) Economics has much to do with texting's popularity. Text messages cost carriers less than traditional mobile voice transmissions, and so they cost users less. Sprint Nextel has reconceived its Virgin Mobile brand to cater to heavy texters in a difficult economy. For  \  25  per month, users get unlimited texting, email, social networking and 300 talk minutes; for another  \  15 , they get an additional 900 talk minutes. The name of the brand's new wireless plan: "Beyond Talk."

(5) Texting's rise over conversation is changing the way we interact, social scientists and researchers say. We are now inclined to text to relay difficult information. We stare at our phone when we want to avoid eye contact. Rather than make plans in advance, we engage in what researchers have named "micro-coordination"-"I'll txt u in 10 mins when I know wh/resrnt."

(6) Texting saves us time, but it steals from quiet reflection. "When people have a mobile device and have even a little extra time, they will communicate with someone in their life," says Lee Rainie, Director of the Pew Internet and American Life Project.

(7) And the phone conversation will never be completely out. Deal makers and other professionals still spend much of the day on the phone. Researchers say people are more likely to use text-based communication at the preliminary stages of projects. The phone comes into play when there are multiple options to consider or important decisions to be made.

47. At the beginning of the passage, the author uses figures for the purpose of.
[A] introduction
[B] comparison
[C] explanation
[D] transition
48. Which of the following is NOT mentioned as a cause for texting's popularity?
[A] Redesign of mobile devices.
[B] Rise of social media.
[C] Promotion of cheaper wireless packages.
[D] Increase in the number of adult texters.

#### PASSAGE FOUR

(1) The healthy adolescent boy or girl likes to do the real things in life, to do the things that matter. He would rather be a plumber's mate and do a real job that requires doing than learn about hydrostatics sitting at a desk, without understanding what practical use they are going to be. A girl would rather look after the baby than learn about child care. Logically should learn about things before doing and that is presumably why the experts enforce this in our educational system. But it is not the natural way - nor, I venture to think, the best way. The adolescent wants to do things first for only then does he appreciate the problems involved and want to learn more about them.

(2) They do these things better in primitive life, for there the adolescent boy joins his father in making canoes and going out fishing or hunting. He is serving his apprenticeship in the actual accomplishments of life. It is not surprising that anthropologists (人类学家) find that the adolescents of primitive communities do not suffer from the same neurotic (神经质的) "difficulties" as those of civilized life. This is not, as some assume, because they are permitted more freedom, but because they are given more natural outlets for their native interests and powers and allowed to grow up freely into a full life of responsibility in the community.

(3) In the 19th century this was recognized in the apprenticeship system, which allowed the boy to go out with the master carpenter or thatcher, to engage in the actual work of carpentry or roof-mending, and so to learn his trade. In some agricultural colleges at the present time young men have to do a year's work on a farm before their theoretical training at college. The great advantage of this system is that it lets the apprentice see the practical problems before he sets to work learning how to solve them, and he can therefore take a more intelligent interest in his theoretical work.

(4) Since more knowledge of more things is now required in order to cope with the adult world, the period of growing-up to independence takes much longer than it did in a more primitive community, and the responsibility for such education, which formerly was in the hands of the parents, is now necessarily undertaken by experts at school. But that should not make us lose sight of the basic principle, namely the need and the desire of the adolescent to engage responsibility in the real pursuits of life and then to learn how-to learn through responsibility, not to learn before responsibility.

49. According to the author, what is the natural way of education?
[A] Doing things while learning.
[B] Doing things as an apprentice.
[C] Doing things before learning.
[D] Learning practical knowledge first.
50. According to the context, "this" in the third paragraph refers to  .
[A] the difficulties modern adolescents experience
[B] the amount of freedom in learning in primitive life
[C] the kind of skills boys learned from their father
[D] the way of learning in primitive communities

Electricity is such a part of our everyday lives and so much taken for granted nowadays that we rarely think twice when we switch on the light or turn on the TV set. At night, roads are brightly lit, enabling people and (31)   to move freely. Neon lighting used in advertising has become part of the character of every modern city. In the home, many (32)   devices are powered by electricity. Even when we turn off the bedside lamp and are (33)   asleep, electricity is working for us, driving our refrigerators, heating our water, or keeping our rooms air-conditioned. Every day, trains, buses and subways take us to and from work. We rarely (34)   to consider why or how they run - until something goes wrong.

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are several passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each question, there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) Inundated by more information than we can possibly hold in our heads, we're increasingly handing off the job of remembering to search engines and smart phones. Google is even reportedly working on eyeglasses that could one day recognize faces and supply details about whoever you're looking at. But new research shows that outsourcing our memory - and expecting that information will be continually and instantaneously available - is changing our cognitive habits.
(2) Research conducted by Betsy Sparrow, an assistant professor of psychology at Columbia University, has identified three new realities about how we process information in the Internet age. First, her experiments showed that when we don't know the answer to a question, we now think about where we can find the nearest Web connection instead of the subject of the question itself. A second revelation is that when we expect to be able to find information again later on, we don't remember it as well as when we think it might become unavailable. And then there is the researchers' final observation: the expectation that we'll be able to locate information down the line leads us to form a memory not of the fact itself but of where we'll be able to find it.
(3) But this handoff comes with a downside. Skills like critical thinking and analysis must develop in the context of facts; we need something to think and reason about, after all. And these facts can't be Googled as we go; they need to be stored in the original hard drive, our long-term memory. Especially in the case of children, "factual knowledge must precede skill," says Daniel Willingham, a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia - meaning that the days of drilling the multiplication table and memorizing the names of the Presidents aren't over quite yet. Adults, too, need to recruit a supply of stored knowledge in order to situate and evaluate new information they encounter. You can't Google context.
(4) Last, there's the possibility, increasingly terrifying to contemplate, that our machines will fail us. As Sparrow puts it, "The experience of losing our Internet connection becomes more and more like losing a friend. If you're going to keep your memory on your smart phone, better make sure it's fully charged.

41. Google's eyeglasses are supposed to   .
[A] improve our memory
[B] function like memory
[C] help us see faces better
[D] work like smart phones
42. Which of the following statements about Sparrow's research is CORRECT?
[A] We remember people and things as much as before.
[B] We remember more Internet connections than before.
[C] We pay equal attention to location and content of information.
[D] We tend to remember location rather than the core of facts.
43. What is the implied message of the author?
[A] Web connections aid our memory.
[B] People differ in what to remember.
[C] People need to exercise their memory.
[D] People keep memory on smart phones.

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) I was a second-year medical student at the university, and was on my second day of rounds at a nearby hospital. My university's philosophy was to get students seeing patients early in their education. Nice idea, but it overlooked one detail: second-year students know next to nothing about medicine.
(2) Assigned to my team that day was an attending - a senior faculty member who was there mostly to make patients feel they weren't in the hands of amateurs. Many attendings were researchers who didn't have much recent hospital experience. Mine was actually an arthritis specialist. Also along was a resident (the real boss, with a staggering mastery of medicine, at least to a rookie like myself). In addition, there were two interns (住院实习医生). These guys were just as green as I was, but in a scarier way: they had recently graduated from the medical school, so they were technically MDs.
(3) I began the day at 6:30 am. An intern and I did a quick check of our eight patients; later, we were to present our findings to the resident and then to the attending. I had three patients and the intern had the other five—piece of cake.
(4) But when I arrived in the room of 70-year-old Mr. Adams, he was sitting up in bed, sweating heavily and panting（喘气）. He'd just had a hip operation and looked terrible. I listened to his lungs with my stethoscope, but they sounded clear. Next I checked the log of his vital signs and saw that his respiration and heart rate had been climbing, but his temperature was steady. It didn't seem like heart failure, nor did it appear to be pneumonia. So I asked Mr. Adams what he thought was going on.
(5) "It's really hot in here, Doc," he replied.
(6) So I attributed his condition to the stuffy room and told him the rest of the team would return in a few hours. He smiled and feebly waved goodbye.
(7) At 8:40 am, during our team meeting, "Code Blue Room 307!" blared from the loudspeaker.
(8) I froze.
(9) That was Mr. Adams's room.
(10) When we arrived, he was motionless.
(11) The autopsy（尸体解剖）later found Mr. Adams had suffered a massive pulmonary embolism（肺部栓塞）. A blood clot had formed in his leg, worked its way to his lungs, and cut his breathing capacity in half. His symptoms had been textbook: heavy perspiration and shortness of breath despite clear lungs. The only thing was: I hadn't read that chapter in the textbook yet. And I was too scared, insecure, and proud to ask a real doctor for help.
(12) This mistake has haunted me for nearly 30 years, but what's particularly frustrating is that the same medical education system persists. Who knows how many people have died or suffered harm at the hands of students as naive as I, and how many more will?

44. We learn that the author's team members had   .
[A] much practical experience
[B] adequate knowledge
[C] long been working there
[D] some professional deficiency
45. "His symptoms had been textbook" means that his symptoms were   .
[A] part of the textbook
[B] no longer in the textbook
[C] recently included in the textbook
[D] explained in the textbook
46. At the end of the passage, the author expresses   about the medical education system.
[A] optimism
[B] hesitation
[C] concern
[D] support

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) The war on smoking, now five decades old and counting, is one of the nation's greatest public health success stories—but not for everyone.
(2) As a whole, the country has made amazing progress. In 1964, four in ten adults in the US smoked; today fewer than two in ten do. But some states - Kentucky, South Dakota and Alabama, to name just a few - seem to have missed the message that smoking is deadly.
(3) Their failure is the greatest disappointment in an effort to save lives that was started on Jan. 11, 1964, by the first Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health. Its finding that smoking is a cause of lung cancer and other diseases was major news then. The hazards of smoking were just starting to emerge.
(4) The report led to cigarette warning labels, a ban on TV ads and eventually an anti-smoking movement that shifted the nation's attitude on smoking. Then, smokers were cool. Today, many are outcasts, rejected by restaurants, bars, public buildings and even their own workplaces. Millions of lives have been saved.
(5) The formula for success is no longer guesswork: Adopt tough warning labels, air public service ads, fund smoking cessation programs and impose smoke-free laws. But the surest way to prevent smoking, particularly among price-sensitive teens, is to raise taxes. If you can stop them from smoking, you've won the war. Few people start smoking after turning 19.
(6) The real-life evidence of taxing power is powerful. The 10 states with the lowest adult smoking rates slap an average tax of $\$ 2.42$ on every pack - three times the average tax in the states with the highest smoking rates.
(7) New York has the highest cigarette tax in the country, at $\$ 4.35$ per pack, and just 12 percent of teens smoke - far below the national average of 18 percent. Compare that with Kentucky, where taxes are low (60 cents), smoking restrictions are weak and the teen smoking rate is double New York's. Other low-tax states have similarly dismal records.
(8) Enemies of high tobacco taxes cling to the tired argument that they fall disproportionately on the poor. True, but so do the deadly effects of smoking - far worse than a tax. The effect of the taxes is amplified further when the revenue is used to fund initiatives that help smokers quit or persuade teens not to start.
(9) Anti-smoking forces have plenty to celebrate this week, having helped avoid 8 million premature deaths in the past 50 years. But as long as 3,000 adolescents and teens take their first puff each day, the war is not won.

47. According to the context, "Their failure" refers to   .
[A] those adults who continue to smoke
[B] those states that missed the message
[C] findings of the report
[D] hazards of smoking
48. What is the passage mainly about?
[A] How to stage anti-smoking campaigns.
[B] The effects of the report on smoking and health.
[C] Tax as the surest path to cut smoking.
[D] The efforts to cut down on teenage smoking.

#### PASSAGE FOUR

(1) Attachment Parenting is not Indulgent Parenting. Attachment parents do not "spoil" their children. Spoiling is done when a child is given everything that they want regardless of what they need and regardless of what is practical. Indulgent parents give toys for tantrums, ice cream for breakfast. Attachment parents don't give their children everything that they want, they give their children everything that they need. Attachment parents believe that love and comfort are free and necessary. Not sweets or toys.
(2) Attachment Parenting is not "afraid of tears" parenting. Our kids cry. The difference is that we understand that tantrums and tears come from emotions and not manipulation. And our children understand this too. They cry and have tantrums sometimes, of course. But they do this because their emotions are so overwhelming that they need to get it out. They do not expect to be "rewarded" for their strong negative emotions; they simply expect that we will listen. We pick up our babies when they cry, and we respond to the tears of our older children because we believe firmly that comfort is free, love is free, and that when a child has need for comfort and love, it is our job to provide those things. We are not afraid of tears. We don't avoid them. We hold our children through them and teach them that when they are hurt or frustrated we are here to comfort them and help them work through their emotions.
(3) Attachment Parenting is not Clingy Parenting. I do not cling to my children. In fact, I'm pretty free-range. As soon as they can move they usually move away from me and let me set up a chase as they crawl, run, skip and hop on their merry way to explore the world. Sure, I carry them and hug them and chase them and kiss them and rock and sleep with them. But this is not me following them everywhere and pulling them back to me. This is me being a home base. The "attachment" comes from their being allowed to attach to us, not from us attaching to them like parental leeches.
(4) Attachment Parenting is not Selfish Parenting. It is also not selfless parenting. We are not doing it for us, and we are not doing it to torment ourselves.
(5) Attachment Parenting is not Helicopter Parenting. I don't hover, I supervise, I follow, I teach, I demonstrate, I explain. I don't slap curious hands away. I show how do things safely. I let my child do the things that my child wishes to do, first with help and then with supervision and finally with trust. I don't insist that my 23 month old hold my hand when we walk on the sidewalk because I know that I can recall him with my voice because he trusts me to allow him to explore and he trusts me to explain when something is dangerous and to help satisfy his curiosities safely.
(6) Most of the negative things that I hear about "attachment parents" are completely off-base and describe something that is entirely unlike Attachment Parenting. Attachment Parenting is child-centric and focuses on the needs of the child. Children need structure, rules, and boundaries. Attachment Parents simply believe that the child and the parent are allies, not adversaries. And that children are taught, not trained.

49. According to the author, what should parents do when their kids cry?
[A] Providing comfort and love.
[B] Trying to stop kids crying.
[C] Holding them till they stop.
[D] Rewarding kids with toys.
50. What does "free-range" mean according to the passage?
[A] Fond of providing a home base.
[B] Ready to play games with my kids.
[C] Curious to watch what games they play.
[D] Willing to give kids freedom of movement.

| Daycare centers can provide children with the <br> professional childhood education, because generally <br> there are well-trained teachers in daycare centers to <br> teach children different skills, such as dancing, singing <br> and painting through various activities. | Normally, there are more than twenty or thirty children <br> per class in daycare centers. However, only two or three <br> teachers are assigned to take charge of one class. <br> Therefore, children are less likely to get the one-on-one <br> care because of the limited number of caregivers. |
| More opportunities are provided in daycare centers for <br> children to play with other peers, which can not only <br> increase their social interactions, but also make them <br> learn a little about unity and team spirits. | Children may not get as much love and attention from <br> the caregivers in daycare centers as from their relatives. <br> For instance, grandparents always have enough time, <br> patience and love to take care of their grandchildren. |
| Living in daycare centers helps children gain <br> independence and confidence since they can do things <br> by themselves and have more freedom in making their <br> own choice. | Children may get ill-treated by caregivers in daycare <br> centers. Some of the teachers can easily lose temper and <br> get angry at the children who have no defense. |

| A. ample     | B. combinations | C. directly      | D. disseminated | E. generations |

Imagine a world without writing. Obviously there would be no books: no novels, no encyclopedias, no cookbooks, no textbooks, no telephone books, no scriptures, no diaries, no travel guides. There would be no ball-points, no typewriters, no computers, no Internet, no magazines, no movie credits, no shopping lists, no newspapers, no tax returns. But such (31)   of subjects almost miss the point. The world we live in has been indelibly marked by the written word, (32)   by the technology of writing over thousands of years. Ancient kings proclaimed their authority and (33)   their laws in writing. Scribes administered great empires by writing, their knowledge of recording and retrieving information essential to governing complex societies. Religious traditions were passed on through (34)   , and spread to others, in writing. Scientific and technological progress was achieved and   (35) through writing. Accounts in trade and commerce could be kept because of writing. Nearly every step of civilization has been mediated through writing. A world without writing would bear (36)   resemblance to the one we now live in. Writing is a (37)   necessity to the societies anthropologists call civilizations. A civilization is distinguished from other societies by the complexity of its social organization, by its construction of cities and large public buildings, and by the economic specialization of its members, many of whom are not (38)   involved in food procurement or production. A civilization, with its taxation and tribute systems, its trade and its public works, requires a (39)   system of record keeping. And so the early civilizations of Egypt, China, and (probably) India all developed a system of writing. Only the Peruvian civilization of the Incas and their predecessors did not use writing but (40)   invented a system of keeping records on knotted color-coded strings known as quipu.

## PART V READING COMPREHENSION

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are three passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each multiple choice question, there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) When I was twenty-seven years old, I was a mining-broker's clerk in San Francisco, and an expert in all the details of stock traffic. I was alone in the world, and had nothing to depend upon but my wits and a clean reputation; but these were setting my feet in the road to eventual fortune, and I was content with the prospect. My time was my own after the afternoon board, Saturdays, and I was accustomed to putting it in on a little sail-boat on the bay. One day I ventured too far, and was carried out to sea. Just at nightfall, when hope was about gone, I was picked up by a small ship which was bound for London. It was a long and stormy voyage, and they made me work my passage without pay, as a common sailor. When I stepped ashore in London my clothes were ragged and shabby, and I had only a dollar in my pocket. This money fed and sheltered me twenty-four hours. During the next twenty-four I went without food and shelter.

(2) About ten o'clock on the following morning, dirty and hungry, I was dragging myself along Portland Place, when a child that was passing, towed by a nurse-maid, tossed a big pear—minus one bite—into the gutter. I stopped, of course, and fastened my desiring eye on that muddy treasure. My mouth watered for it, my stomach craved it, my whole being begged for it. But every time I made a move to get it some passing eye detected my purpose, and of course I straightened up then, and looked indifferent and pretended that I hadn't been thinking about the pear at all. This same thing kept happening and happening, and I couldn't get the pear.

(3) I was just getting desperate enough to brave all the shame, and to seize it, when a window behind me was raised, and a gentleman spoke out of it, saying: "Step in here, please."

(4) I was admitted by a man servant, and shown into a sumptuous room where a couple of elderly gentlemen were sitting. They sent away the servant, and made me sit down. They had just finished their breakfast, and the sight of the remains of it almost overpowered me. I could hardly keep my wits together in the presence of that food, but as I was not asked to sample it, I had to bear my trouble as best as I could.

(5) Now, something had been happening there a little before, which I did not know anything about until a good many days afterwards, but I will tell you about it now. Those two old brothers had been having a pretty hot argument a couple of days before, and had ended by agreeing to decide it by a bet, which is the English way of settling everything.

(6) You will remember that the Bank of England once issued two notes of a million pounds each, to be used for a special purpose connected with some public transaction with a foreign country. For some reason or other only one of these had been used and canceled; the other still lay in the vaults of the Bank. Well, the brothers chatting along, happened to get to wondering what might be the fate of a perfectly honest and intelligent stranger who should be turned adrift in London without a friend, and with no money but that million-pound bank-note, and no way to account for his being in possession of it. Brother A said he would starve to death; Brother B said he wouldn't. Brother A said he couldn't offer it at a bank or anywhere else, because he would be arrested on the spot. So they went on disputing till Brother B said he would bet twenty thousand pounds that the man would live thirty days, anyway, and keep out of jail, too. Brother A took him up. Brother B went down to the Bank and bought that note. Then he dictated a letter, which one of his clerks wrote out in a beautiful round hand, and then the two brothers sat at the window a whole day watching for the right man to give it to.

(7) I finally became the pick of them.

41. In Para. 1, the phrase "set my feet" probably means   .
[A] put me aside
[B] prepare me
[C] let me walk
[D] start my journey
42. It can be concluded from Para. 2 that   .
[A] the man wanted to maintain dignity though starved
[B] the man could not get a proper chance to eat the pear
[C] the man did not really want the pear since it was dirty
[D] it was very difficult for the man to get the pear
43. Compared with Brother A, Brother B was more   towards the effect of the one-million-pound bank-note on a total stranger.
[A] neutral
[B] negative
[C] reserved
[D] positive

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) The concept of peace is a very important one in cultures all over the world. Think about how we greet people. In some languages, the phrases for greetings contain the word for peace. In some cultures we greet people by shaking hands or with another gesture to show that we are not carrying weapons - that we come in peace. And there are certain symbols which people in very different cultures recognize as representing peace. Let's look at a few of them.

### The dove

(2) The dove has been a symbol of peace and innocence for thousands of years in many different cultures. In ancient Greek mythology it was a symbol of love and the renewal of life. In ancient Japan a dove carrying a sword symbolized the end of war.

(3) There was a tradition in Europe that if dove flew around a house where someone was dying then their soul would be at peace. And there are legends which say that devil can turn himself into any bird except for a dove. In Christian art, the dove was used to symbolize the Holy Ghost and was often painted above Christ's head.

(4) But it was Pablo Picasso who made the dove a modern symbol of peace when he used it on a poster for the World Peace Congress in 1949.

### The rainbow

(5) The rainbow is another ancient and universal symbol, often representing the connection between human beings and their gods. In Greek mythology it was associated with Iris, the goddess who brought messages from the gods on Mount Olympus. In Scandinavian mythology the rainbow was a bridge between the gods and the earth. In the Bible a rainbow showed Noah that the Biblical flood was finally over, and that God had forgiven his people. In the Chinese tradition, the rainbow is a common symbol for marriage because the colours represent the union of yin and yang. Nowadays the rainbow is used by many popular movements for peace and the environment, representing the possibility of a better world in the future and promising sunshine after rain.

### Mistletoe

(6) This plant was sacred in many cultures, generally representing peace and love. Most people know of the tradition of kissing under the mistletoe at Christmas time, which probably comes from Scandinavian mythology. The goddess Freya's son was killed by an arrow made of mistletoe, so, in honour of him, she declared that it would always be a symbol of peace. It was often hung in doorways as a sign of friendship.

(7) The ancient Druids believed that hanging mistletoe in your doorway could protect you from evil spirits. Tribes would stop fighting for a period of time if they found a tree with mistletoe. But you will never see mistletoe in a Christian church - it is banned because of its associations with pagan religion and superstition.

### The olive branch

(8) The olive tree has always been a valuable source of food and oil. In Greek mythology, the goddess Athena gave the olive tree to the people of Athens, who showed their gratitude by naming the city after her. But no one knows for sure when or why it began to symbolize peace. There is probably a connection with ancient Greece. Wars between states were suspended during the Olympics Games, and the winners were given crowns of olive branches. The symbolism may come from the fact that the olive tree takes a long time to produce fruit, so olives could only be cultivated successfully in long periods of peace. Whatever the history, the olive branch is a part of many modern flags symbolizing peace and unity. One well-known example is the United Nations symbol.

### The ankh

(9) The ankh is an ancient symbol which was adopted by the hippie movement in the 1960s to represent peace and love. It was found in many Asian cultures, but is generally associated with ancient Egypt. It represented life and immortality. Egyptians were buried with an ankh, so that they could continue to live in the "afterworld". The symbol was also found along the sides of the Nile, which gave life to the people. They believed that the ankh could control the flow of the river and make sure that there was always enough water.

44. Which of the following is the best title for the passage?
[A] Concept of Peace.
[B] Popular Peace Symbols.
[C] Origin of Peace Symbols.
[D] Cultural Difference of Peace.
45. The rainbow represents the connection between human beings and their gods in all the following countries EXCEPT   .
[A] Sweden
[B] Greece
[C] Finland
[D] China
46. In North Europe mistletoe was often hung in doorways to indicate   .

[D] honour
47. The origin of the ankh can date back to   .
[A] the Nile
[B] the "afterworld"
[C] the hippie movement
[D] ancient Egypt

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) Two sides almost never change: That you can manipulate people into self-sufficiency and that you can punish them into good citizenship.

(2) The first manifests itself in our tireless search for the magical level at which welfare grants are big enough to meet basic needs but small enough to make low-paid work attractive. The second gets us to think about "workforce".

(3) We've been thinking about it for two reasons: the "nanny" problems of two high-ranking government officials (who hired undocumented foreigners as household helpers, presumably because they couldn't find Americans to do the work) and President Clinton's proposal to put a two-year limit on welfare.

(4) Maybe something useful will come of Clinton's idea, but I'm not all that hopeful. It looks to me like one more example of trying to manipulate people into taking care of themselves.

(5) On the criminal justice side, we hope to make punishment tough enough to discourage crime but not so tough as to clog our prisons with relatively minor offenders. Too short a sentence, we fear, will create contempt for the law. Too long a sentence will take up costly space better used for the violent and unremorseful.

(6) Not only can we never find the "perfect" punishment, our search for optimum penalties is complicated by our desire for fairness: to let the punishment fit the crime. The problem is that almost any punishment - even the disgrace of being charged with a crime - is sufficient to deter the middle class, while for members of the underclass, probation may be translated as "I beat it".

(7) So how can you use the system - welfare or criminal justice - to produce the behavior we want? The answer, I suspect is: You can't.

(8) We keep trying to use welfare and prison to change people - to make them think and behave the way we do - when the truth is the incentives work only for those who already think the way we do: who view today's action with an eye on the future.

(9) We will take lowly work (if that is all that's available) because we believe we can make bad jobs work for us. We avoid crime not because we are better people but because we see getting caught as a future-wrecking disaster. We are guided by a belief that good things will happen for us in the future if we take proper care of the present. Even under the worst of circumstances, we believe we are in control of our lives.

(10) And we have trouble understanding that not everybody believes as we believe. The welfare rolls, the prison and the mean street of our cities are full of people who have given up on their future. Without hope for the future, hard work at a low-paid job makes no sense. Working hard in school, or pleasing a boss, or avoiding pregnancy makes no sense. The deadly disease is hopelessness. The lawlessness and poverty are only the obvious symptoms.

(11) I'm not advocating that we stop looking for incentives to move poor people toward self-sufficiency or that we stop punishing people for criminal behavior. There will always be some people who need help and some who deserve to be in jail.

(12) All I'm saying is that the long-term answer both to welfare and the crime that plagues our communities is not to fine tune the welfare and criminal justice systems but to prevent our children from getting the disease of despair.

(13) If we encourage our young people to believe in the future, and give them solid evidence for believing, we'll find both crime and poverty shrinking to manageable proportions.

48. What is the author's attitude towards Clinton's proposal to welfare?
[A] Pessimistic.
[B] Optimistic.
[C] Suspicious.
[D] Sarcastic.
49. It can be inferred from Para. 7 that optimum penalties are   to the underclass.
[A] hopeless
[B] useless
[C] frightening
[D] humiliating
50. Which of the following is the most appropriate title for the passage?
[A] Lawlessness and Poverty.
[B] Criminal Justice System.
[C] Welfare Grants.
[D] Disease of Despair.

### Term-time holidays will be banned

Parents are to be banned by Michael Gove, UK's Education Secretary, from taking their children out of school to save money on holidays.

He is to abolish the right of head teacher to "authorise absence" from the classroom, which has been used to let families take term-time breaks, and will warn them they face fines for their children not being at school.
"Any time out of school has the potential to damage a child's education," a senior source at the Department for Education said this weekend. "That is why the government will end the distinction between authorised and unauthorised absence."
"This is part of the government's wider commitment to bring down truancy levels in our schools. There will also be stricter penalties for parents and schools."

The tough measures on truancy are part of a wider attempt by Mr. Gove to make education more academically rigorous and to tackle a culture in the educational establishment which he believes has accepted "excuses for failure".

Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the measure would discourage parents from trying to put pressure on heads to sanction term-time holiday. "The high cost of holidays outside of term time is still an issue but ultimately a child's education is more important than a holiday," he said.

Millions of people now rent their movies the Netflix way. They fill out a wish list from 50,009 titles on the company's web site and receive the first few DVD's in the mail; when they mail each one back, the next one on the list is sent. The Netflix model has been exhaustively analyzed for its disruptive, new-economy (31)   . What will it mean for video stores like Blockbuster? What will it mean for movie studios and theaters? What does it show about "long tail" businesses - ones that combine many markets into a (32)   target audience?

## PART V READING COMPREHENSION

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are three passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each multiple choice question, there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) When I was a young girl living in Ireland, I was always pleased when it rained, because that meant I could go treasure hunting. What's the connection between a wet day and a search for buried treasure? Well, it's quite simple. Ireland, as some of you may already know, is the home of Leprechauns - little men who possess magic powers and, perhaps more interestingly, pots of gold.
(2) Now, although Leprechauns are interesting characters, I was more interested in the stories of their treasure hoard. This, as all of Ireland knows, they hide at the end of the rainbow. Leprechauns can be fearsome folk but if you can discover the end of the rainbow, they have to unwillingly surrender their gold to you. So whenever it rained, I would look up in the sky and follow the curve of the rainbow to see where it ended. I never did unearth any treasure, but I did spend many happy, showery days dreaming of what I could do with the fortune if I found it.
(3) As I got older, and started working, rainy days came to be just another nuisance and my childhood dreams of finding treasure faded. But for some people the dream of striking it lucky never fades, and for a fortunate few, the dream even comes true! Such is the case of Mel Fisher. His dream of finding treasure also began in childhood, while reading the great literature classics "Treasure Island" and "Moby Dick". However, unlike me, he chased his dream and in the end managed to become one of the most famous professional treasure hunters of all time, and for good reason. In 1985, he fished up the priceless cargo of the sunken Spanish ship Atocha, which netted him an incredible 400 million dollars!
(4) After the ship sank in 1622 off the coast of Florida, its murky waters became a treasure-trove (埋藏的宝藏) of precious stones, gold bars and silver coins known as "pieces of eight". The aptly-named Fisher, who ran a commercial salvaging operation, had been trying to locate the underwater treasure for over 16 years when he finally hit the jackpot! His dreams had come true but finding and keeping the treasure wasn't all plain sailing. After battling with hostile conditions at sea, Fisher then had to battle in the courts. In fact, the State of Florida took Fisher to court over ownership of the find and the Federal government soon followed suit. After more than 200 hearings, Fisher agreed to donate $20 \%$ of his findings for public display, and so now there is a museum in Florida which displays hundreds of the objects which were salvaged from the Atocha.
(5) This true story seems like a modern-day fairytale: a man pursues his dream through hardship and in the end, he triumphs over the difficulties - they all live happily ever after, right? Well, not exactly. Archaeologists object to the fact that with commercial salvaging operations like Fisher's, the objects are sold and dispersed, and UNESCO are also worried about protecting our underwater heritage from what it describes as "pillaging" (抢劫、掠夺).
(6) The counter-argument is that in professional, well-run operations such as Fisher's, each piece is accurately and minutely recorded and that it is this information which is more important than the actual object, and that such operations help increase our wealth of archaeological knowledge. Indeed, as in Fisher's case, they make history more accessible to people through museum donations and information on web sites.
(7) The distinction of whether these treasure hunters are salvaging or pillaging our underwater heritage may not be clear, but what is clear is that treasure hunting is not just innocent child's play anymore but profitable big business. I have learnt that the end of the rainbow is beyond my reach, but in consolation, with just a click of the mouse, I too can have a share in the riches that the Atocha has revealed. As Friedrich Nietzsche so wisely said: "Our treasure lies in the beehive of our knowledge."

41. In Para. 4, the phrase "hit the jackpot" means   according to the context.
[A] discovered the jackpot
[B] found the treasure
[C] broke one of the objects
[D] ran a salvaging operation
42. It can be concluded from Paras. 5 and 6 that   .
[A] UNESCO's view is different from archaeologists'
[B] all salvaging operations should be prohibited
[C] attention should be paid to the find's educational value
[D] people hold entirely different views on the issue
43. How did the author feel about the treasure from the Atocha (Para. 7)?
[A] She was glad that people can have a chance to see the treasure.
[B] She was sad that she was unable to discover and salvage treasure.
[C] She was angry that treasure hunters were pillaging heritage.
[D] She was unconcerned about where the treasure came from.

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) The concept of peace is a very important one in cultures all over the world. Think about how we greet people. In some languages, the phrases for greetings contain the word for peace. In some cultures we greet people by shaking hands or with another gesture to show that we are not carrying weapons - that we come in peace. And there are certain symbols which people in very different cultures recognize as representing peace. Let's look at a few of them.

### The dove

(2) The dove has been a symbol of peace and innocence for thousands of years in many different cultures. In ancient Greek mythology it was a symbol of love and the renewal of life. In ancient Japan a dove carrying a sword symbolized the end of war.

(3) There was a tradition in Europe that if dove flew around a house where someone was dying then their soul would be at peace. And there are legends which say that devil can turn himself into any bird except for a dove. In Christian art, the dove was used to symbolize the Holy Ghost and was often painted above Christ's head.

(4) But it was Pablo Picasso who made the dove a modern symbol of peace when he used it on a poster for the World Peace Congress in 1949.

### The rainbow

(5) The rainbow is another ancient and universal symbol, often representing the connection between human beings and their gods. In Greek mythology it was associated with Iris, the goddess who brought messages from the gods on Mount Olympus. In Scandinavian mythology the rainbow was a bridge between the gods and the earth. In the Bible a rainbow showed Noah that the Biblical flood was finally over, and that God had forgiven his people. In the Chinese tradition, the rainbow is a common symbol for marriage because the colours represent the union of yin and yang. Nowadays the rainbow is used by many popular movements for peace and the environment, representing the possibility of a better world in the future and promising sunshine after rain.

### Mistletoe

(6) This plant was sacred in many cultures, generally representing peace and love. Most people know of the tradition of kissing under the mistletoe at Christmas time, which probably comes from Scandinavian mythology. The goddess Freya's son was killed by an arrow made of mistletoe, so, in honour of him, she declared that it would always be a symbol of peace. It was often hung in doorways as a sign of friendship.

(7) The ancient Druids believed that hanging mistletoe in your doorway could protect you from evil spirits. Tribes would stop fighting for a period of time if they found a tree with mistletoe. But you will never see mistletoe in a Christian church - it is banned because of its associations with pagan religion and superstition.

### The olive branch

(8) The olive tree has always been a valuable source of food and oil. In Greek mythology, the goddess Athena gave the olive tree to the people of Athens, who showed their gratitude by naming the city after her. But no one knows for sure when or why it began to symbolize peace. There is probably a connection with ancient Greece. Wars between states were suspended during the Olympics Games, and the winners were given crowns of olive branches. The symbolism may come from the fact that the olive tree takes a long time to produce fruit, so olives could only be cultivated successfully in long periods of peace. Whatever the history, the olive branch is a part of many modern flags symbolizing peace and unity. One well-known example is the United Nations symbol.

### The ankh

(9) The ankh is an ancient symbol which was adopted by the hippie movement in the 1960s to represent peace and love. It was found in many Asian cultures, but is generally associated with ancient Egypt. It represented life and immortality. Egyptians were buried with an ankh, so that they could continue to live in the "afterworld". The symbol was also found along the sides of the Nile, which gave life to the people. They believed that the ankh could control the flow of the river and make sure that there was always enough water.

44. Which of the following is the best title for the passage?
[A] Concept of Peace.
[B] Popular Peace Symbols.
[C] Origin of Peace Symbols.
[D] Cultural Difference of Peace.
45. The rainbow represents the connection between human beings and their gods in all the following countries EXCEPT   .
[A] Sweden
[B] Greece
[C] Finland
[D] China
46. In North Europe mistletoe was often hung in doorways to indicate   .
[A] friendship
[B] love
[C] kinship
[D] honour
47. The origin of the ankh can date back to   .
[A] the Nile
[B] the "afterworld"
[C] the hippie movement
[D] ancient Egypt

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) Two sides almost never change: That you can manipulate people into self-sufficiency and that you can punish them into good citizenship.

(2) The first manifests itself in our tireless search for the magical level at which welfare grants are big enough to meet basic needs but small enough to make low-paid work attractive. The second gets us to think about "workforce".

(3) We've been thinking about it for two reasons: the "nanny" problems of two high-ranking government officials (who hired undocumented foreigners as household helpers, presumably because they couldn't find Americans to do the work) and President Clinton's proposal to put a two-year limit on welfare.

(4) Maybe something useful will come of Clinton's idea, but I'm not all that hopeful. It looks to me like one more example of trying to manipulate people into taking care of themselves.

(5) On the criminal justice side, we hope to make punishment tough enough to discourage crime but not so tough as to clog our prisons with relatively minor offenders. Too short a sentence, we fear, will create contempt for the law. Too long a sentence will take up costly space better used for the violent and unremorseful.

(6) Not only can we never find the "perfect" punishment, our search for optimum penalties is complicated by our desire for fairness: to let the punishment fit the crime. The problem is that almost any punishment - even the disgrace of being charged with a crime - is sufficient to deter the middle class, while for members of the underclass, probation may be translated as "I beat it".

(7) So how can you use the system - welfare or criminal justice - to produce the behavior we want? The answer, I suspect is: You can't.

(8) We keep trying to use welfare and prison to change people - to make them think and behave the way we do - when the truth is the incentives work only for those who already think the way we do: who view today's action with an eye on the future.

(9) We will take lowly work (if that is all that's available) because we believe we can make bad jobs work for us. We avoid crime not because we are better people but because we see getting caught as a future-wrecking disaster. We are guided by a belief that good things will happen for us in the future if we take proper care of the present. Even under the worst of circumstances, we believe we are in control of our lives.

(10) And we have trouble understanding that not everybody believes as we believe. The welfare rolls, the prison and the mean street of our cities are full of people who have given up on their future. Without hope for the future, hard work at a low-paid job makes no sense. Working hard in school, or pleasing a boss, or avoiding pregnancy makes no sense. The deadly disease is hopelessness. The lawlessness and poverty are only the obvious symptoms.

(11) I'm not advocating that we stop looking for incentives to move poor people toward self-sufficiency or that we stop punishing people for criminal behavior. There will always be some people who need help and some who deserve to be in jail.

(12) All I'm saying is that the long-term answer both to welfare and the crime that plagues our communities is not to fine tune the welfare and criminal justice systems but to prevent our children from getting the disease of despair.

(13) If we encourage our young people to believe in the future, and give them solid evidence for believing, we'll find both crime and poverty shrinking to manageable proportions.

48. What is the author's attitude towards Clinton's proposal to welfare?
[A] Pessimistic.
[B] Optimistic.
[C] Suspicious.
[D] Sarcastic.
49. It can be inferred from Para. 7 that optimum penalties are   to the underclass.
[A] hopeless
[B] useless
[C] frightening
[D] humiliating
50. Which of the following is the most appropriate title for the passage?
[A] Lawlessness and Poverty.
[B] Criminal Justice System.
[C] Welfare Grants.
[D] Disease of Despair.

### Term-time holidays will be banned

Parents are to be banned by Michael Gove, UK's Education Secretary, from taking their children out of school to save money on holidays.

He is to abolish the right of head teacher to "authorise absence" from the classroom, which has been used to let families take term-time breaks, and will warn them they face fines for their children not being at school.
"Any time out of school has the potential to damage a child's education," a senior source at the Department for Education said this weekend. "That is why the government will end the distinction between authorised and unauthorised absence."
"This is part of the government's wider commitment to bring down truancy levels in our schools. There will also be stricter penalties for parents and schools."

The tough measures on truancy are part of a wider attempt by Mr. Gove to make education more academically rigorous and to tackle a culture in the educational establishment which he believes has accepted "excuses for failure".

Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the measure would discourage parents from trying to put pressure on heads to sanction term-time holiday. "The high cost of holidays outside of term time is still an issue but ultimately a child's education is more important than a holiday," he said.

A few years ago, a university professor tried a little experiment. He sent Christmas cards to a sample of perfect strangers. Although he expected some reaction, the response he received was amazing—holiday cards addressed to him came pouring back from the people who had never met nor heard of him. The great majority of those who returned a card never inquired into the identity of the (31)   professor. They received his holiday greeting card, and they (32)   sent one in return. This study shows the action of one of the most powerful of the weapons of influence around us—the rule for reciprocation. The rule says that we should try to repay, in (33)   , what another person has provided us. If a woman does us a favor, we should do her (34)   in return; if a man sends us a birthday present, we should remember his birthday with a gift of our own; if a (35)   invites us to a party, we should be sure to invite them to one of ours. By (36)   of the reciprocity rule, then, we are obliged to the future repayment of favors, gifts, invitations, and the like. So typical is it for (37)   to accompany the receipt of such things that a term like "much obliged" has become a synonym for "thank you," not only in the English language but in others as well.

The impressive aspect of the rule for reciprocation and the sense of obligation that (38)   with it is its pervasiveness in human culture. It is so (39)   that after intensive study, sociologists can report that there is no human society that does not (40)   to the rule.

## PART V READING COMPREHENSION

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are three passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each multiple choice question, there are four suggested answers marked [A], [B], [C] and [D]. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) The earliest settlers came to the North American continent to establish colonies which were free from the controls that existed in European societies. They wanted to escape the controls placed on their lives by kings and governments, priests and churches, noblemen and aristocrats. The historic decisions made by those first settlers have had a profound effect on the shaping of the American character. By limiting the power of the government and the churches and eliminating a formal freedom is probably the most basic of all American values. By "freedom," Americans mean the desire and the ability of all individuals to control their own destiny without outside interference from the government, a ruling noble class, the church, or any other organized authority.
(2) There is, however, a price to be paid for this individual freedom: self-reliance. It means that Americans believe that they should stand on their own feet, achieving both financial and emotional independence from their parents as early as possible, usually by age 18 or 21.
(3) A second important reason why immigrants have traditionally been drawn to the United States is the belief that everyone has an equal chance to enter a race and succeed in the game. Because titles of nobility were forbidden in the Constitution, no formal class system developed in the US.
(4) There is, however, a price to be paid for this equality of opportunity: competition. If much of life is seen as a race, then a person must run the race in order to succeed; a person must compete with others. The pressures of competition in the life of an American begin in childhood and continue until retirement from work. In fact, any group of people who does not compete successfully does not fit into the mainstream of American life as well as those who do.
(5) A third reason why immigrants have traditionally come to the United States is to have a better life. Because of its abundant natural resources, the United States appeared to be a "land of plenty" where millions could come to seek their fortunes. The phrase "going from rags to riches" became a slogan for the American dream. Many people did achieve material success. Material wealth became a value to the American people, and it also became an accepted measure of social status.
(6) Americans pay a price, however, for their material wealth: hard work. Hard work has been both necessary and rewarding for most Americans throughout their history. In some ways, material possessions are seen as evidence of people's abilities. Barry Goldwater, a candidate for the presidency in 1964, said that most poor people are poor because they deserve to be. Most Americans would find this a harsh statement, but many might think there was some truth in it.
(7) These basic values do not tell the whole story of the American character. Rather, they should be thought of as themes, as we continue to explore more facets of the American character and how it affects life in the United States.

41. Para. 4 seems to suggest that   .
[A] Americans are born with a sense of competition
[B] the pressure of competition begins when one starts work
[C] competition results in equality of opportunities
[D] successful competition is essential in American society
42. Which of the following methods does the author mainly use in explaining American values?
[A] Comparison.
[B] Cause and effect.
[C] Definition.
[D] Process analysis.

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) The Nobels are the originals, of course. Alfred Nobel, the man who invented deadly explosives, decided to try and do something good with all the money he earned, and gave prizes to people who made progress in literature, science, economics and—perhaps most importantly—peace.
(2) Not all awards are as noble as the Nobels. Even though most countries have a system for recognizing, honoring and rewarding people who have done something good in their countries, there are now hundreds of awards and awards ceremonies for all kinds of things.
(3) The Oscars are probably the most famous, a time for the (mostly) American film industry to tell itself how good it is, an annual opportunity for big stars to give each other awards and make tearful speeches. As well as that there are also the Golden Globes, apparently for the same thing.
(4) But it's not only films—now there are also Grammies, Brits, the Mercury Prize and the MTV and Q awards for music. In Britain, a writer who wins the Booker prize can expect to see their difficult, literary novel hit the bestseller lists and compete with "The Da Vinci Code" for popularity. The Turner Prize is an award for a British contemporary artist—each year it causes controversy by apparently giving a lot of money to artists who do things like displaying their beds, putting animals in glass cases or—this year—building a garden shed.
(5) Awards don't only exist for the arts. There are now awards for Sports Personality of the Year, for European Footballer of the Year and World Footballer of the Year. This seems very strange—sometimes awards can be good to give recognition to people who deserve it, or to help people who don't make much money carry on their work without worrying about finances, but professional soccer players these days certainly aren't short of cash!
(6) Many small towns and communities all over the world also have their own awards ceremonies, for local writers or artists, or just for people who have graduated from high school or got a university degree. Even the British Council has its own awards for "Innovation in English Language Teaching".
(7) Why have all these awards and ceremonies appeared recently? Shakespeare never won a prize, nor did Leonardo da Vinci or Adam Smith or Charles Dickens.
(8) It would be possible to say, however, that in the past, scientists and artists could win "patronage" from rich people—a king or a lord would give the artist or scientist money to have them paint their palaces or help them develop new ways of making money. With the change in social systems across the world, this no longer happens. Scientific research is now either funded by the government or by private companies.
(9) Perhaps awards ceremonies are just the most recent phase of this process.
(10) However, there is more to it than that. When a film wins an Oscar, many more people will go and see it, or buy the DVD. When a writer wins the Nobel Prize, many more people buy their books. When a group wins the MTV awards, the ceremony is seen by hundreds of thousands of people across the world. The result? The group sells a lot more records.
(11) Most awards ceremonies are now sponsored by big organizations or companies. This means that it is not only the person who wins the award who benefits—but also the sponsors. The MTV awards, for example, are great for publicizing not only music, but also MTV itself!
(12) On the surface, it seems to be a "win-win" situation, with everyone being happy, but let me ask you a question—how far do you think that publicity and marketing are winning here, and how much genuine recognition of achievement is taking place?

43. What is the author's tone when he mentions awards such as the Oscars, the Golden Globes and Grammies (Paras. 3 & 4)?
[A] Amused.
[B] Appreciative.
[C] Sarcastic.
[D] Serious.
44. According to Para. 4, what would happen to award-winning writers?
[A] They would enjoy a much larger readership.
[B] They would turn to popular novel writing.
[C] They would continue non-fiction writing.
[D] They would try controversial forms of art.
45. Which of the following statements best sums up Para. 6?
[A] Awards ceremonies are held for local people.
[B] Awards ceremonies are held on important occasions.
[C] Awards ceremonies are held in certain professions.
[D] Awards ceremonies are held for all sorts of reasons.
46. According to Para. 8, one difference between scientists and artists in the past and those at present lies in   .
[A] nature of work.
[B] personal contact.
[C] source of funding.
[D] social status.
47. It can be concluded from Para. 12 that the author thinks awards   .
[A] do good to both market and popularity.
[B] promote market rather than achievements.
[C] help those who are really talented.
[D] are effective in making people popular.

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) Knowing that Mrs Mallard was suffering from a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as gently as possible the news of her husband's death.
(2) It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences. Her husband's friend Richards was there, too, near her. It was he who had been in the newspaper office when news of the railroad disaster was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of "killed". He had only taken the time to assure himself of its truth by a second telegram.
(3) She wept at once, in her sister's arms. When the storm of grief had spent itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.
(4) There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable armchair. Into this she sank, pressed down by a physical exhaustion that haunted her body and seemed to reach into her soul.
(5) She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a peddler was crying his wares. The notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her faintly, and countless sparrows were twittering in the eaves.
(6) There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and piled one above the other in the west facing her window.
(7) She sat with her head thrown back upon the cushion of the chair, quite motionless, except when a sob came up into her throat and shook her, as a child who has cried itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.
(8) She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines indicated repression and even a certain strength. But now there was a dull stare in her eyes, whose gaze was fixed out there on one of those patches of blue sky. It was not a glance of reflection, but rather indicated a suspension of intelligent thought.
(9) There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, fearfully. What was it? She did not know; it was too subtle and thus hard to name. But she felt it, creeping out of the sky, reaching toward her through the sounds, the scents, the color that filled the air.
(10) Now her bosom rose and fell tumultuously. She was beginning to recognize this thing that was approaching to possess her, and she was striving to beat it back with her will—as powerless as her two white slender hands would have been.
(11) When she abandoned herself a little whispered word escaped her slightly parted lips. She said it over and over under her breath: "free, free, free!" The vacant stare and the look of terror that had followed it went from her eyes. They stayed keen and bright. Her pulses beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every inch of her body.
(12) She knew that she would weep again when she saw the kind, tender hands folded in death; the face, fixed and gray and dead. But she saw beyond that bitter moment a long procession of years to come that would belong to her absolutely. And she opened and spread her arms out to them in welcome.
(13) There would be no one to live for during those coming years; she would live for herself. There would be no powerful will bending hers in that blind persistence with which men and women believe they have a right to impose a private will upon a fellow-creature.
(14) And yet she had loved him—sometimes. Often she had not. What did it matter! What could love, the unsolved mystery, count for in face of this possession of self-assertion which she suddenly recognized as the strongest impulse of her being!
(15) "Free! Body and soul free!" she kept whispering.
(16) Josephine was kneeling before the closed door with her lips to the keyhole, imploring for admission. "Louise, open the door! I beg, open the door—you will make yourself ill. What are you doing Louise? For heaven's sake open the door."
(17) "Go away. I am not making myself ill." No; she was drinking in a very elixir of life through that open window.
(18) Her fancy was running riot along those days ahead of her. Spring days, and summer days, and all sorts of days that would be her own. She breathed a quick prayer that life might be long. It was only yesterday she had thought with a shudder that life might be long.
(19) She arose at length and opened the door. There was a feverish triumph in her eyes, and she carried herself unwittingly like a goddess of Victory. She clasped her sister's waist, and together they descended the stairs. Richards stood waiting for them at the bottom.
(20) Someone was opening the front door with a latchkey. It was Brently Mallard who entered, a little travel-stained, composedly carrying his bag and umbrella. He had been far from the scene of accident, and did not even know there had been one. He stood amazed at Josephine's piercing cry; at Richards' quick motion to screen him from the view of his wife.
(21) But Richards was too late.
(22) When the doctors came they said she had died of heart disease—of joy that kills.

48. How did Mrs Mallard get the news of her husband's death?
[A] Her husband's friend told her.
[B] She had read it from the paper.
[C] Her sister Josephine told her.
[D] Her doctor broke the news to her.
49. When Mrs Mallard was alone in her room, she   .
[A] sat with her back facing the window.
[B] sat in an armchair all the time.
[C] sat and then walked around for a while.
[D] sat in a chair and cried all the time.
50. How did she feel about her love towards her husband?
[A] She was indifferent now.
[B] She hated her husband.
[C] She found it hard to describe.
[D] She had loved him all along.

### Report exposes the dark side of conservation

A report launched by Survival International—the global movement for tribal peoples' rights—reveals how conservation has led to the eviction of millions of tribal people from "protected areas," since "protected areas" like national parks should generally be "no go" for mining, agriculture, dams, roads and pipelines.

Survival's report shows that nearly all protected areas are, or have been, the ancestral homelands of tribal peoples, who have been dependent on, and managed them for thousands of years. But in the name of "conservation" tribal people are being "illegally driven out" from these lands and accused of "poaching"; meanwhile, tourists and fee-paying big-game hunters are welcomed in.

Bushman Dauqoo Xukuri from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve in Botswana said, "I sit and look around the country. Wherever there are bushmen, there is game. Why? Because we know how to take care of animals.

Survival's report concludes that the current model of conservation needs a radical shake-up. Conservation must stick to international law, protect tribal peoples' rights to their lands, listen to them, and then be prepared to back them up as much as they can.

Survival's Director Stephen Corry said, "Millions are being spent by conservationists every year, and yet the environment's in deepening crisis. It's time to wake up and realize that there is another way and it's much, much better. Firstly, tribal peoples' rights have to be acknowledged and respected. Secondly, they have to be treated as the best experts at defending their own lands. Conservationists must realize it's they, themselves, who are junior partners."

To some thinkers, it is machines and their development **that** drive economic and cultural change. This idea is referred to as technological determinism. Certainly there can be no doubt that machines contributed to the Protestant Reformation and the decline of the Catholic Church's power in Europe or   (31) television has changed the way family members interact. Those who believe in technological determinism would argue that these changes in the cultural landscape were the   (32) result of new technology.

But others see technology as more neutral and claim that the way people use technology is what gives it significance. This   (33) accepts technology as one of many factors that shape economic and cultural change; technology's influence is   (34) determined by how much power it is given by the people and cultures that use it.

This   (35) about the power of technology is at the heart of the controversy surrounding the new communication technologies. Are we more or less powerless in the   (36) of advances such as the Internet, the World Wide Web, and instant global audio and visual communication? **If** we are at the mercy of technology, the culture that surrounds us will not be of our   (37) and the best we can hope to do is make our way reasonably well in a world outside our own control. But **if** these technologies are indeed neutral and their power   (38) in how we choose to use them, we can utilize them responsibly and   (39) to construct and maintain whatever kind of culture we want. As film director and technophile Steve Spielberg explained, "Technology can be our best friend, and technology can also be the biggest party pooper of our lives. It interrupts our own story, interrupts our ability to have a thought or   (40), to imagine something wonderful."

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) Life can be tough for immigrants in America. As a Romanian bank clerk in Atlanta puts it, to find a good job "you have to be like a wolf in the forest—able to smell out the best meat." And if you can't find work, don't expect the taxpayer to bail you out. Unlike in some European countries, it is extremely hard for an able-bodied immigrant to live off the state. A law passed in 1996 explicitly bars most immigrants, even those with legal status, from receiving almost any federal benefits.

(2) That is one reason why America absorbs immigrants better than many other rich countries, according to a new study by the University of California. The researchers sought to measure the effect of immigration on the native-born in 20 rich countries, taking into account differences in skills between immigrants and natives, imperfect labor markets and the size of the welfare state in each country.

(3) Their results offer ammunition for fans of more open borders. In 19 out of 20 countries, the authors calculated that shutting the doors entirely to foreign workers would make the native-born worse off. Never mind what it would do to the immigrants themselves, who benefit far more than anyone else from being allowed to cross borders to find work.

(4) The study also suggests that most countries could handle more immigration than they currently allow. In America, a one-percentage point increase in the proportion of immigrants in the population made the native-born $0.05\%$ better off. The opposite was true in some countries with generous or ill-designed welfare states, however. A one-point rise in immigration made the native-born slightly worse off in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. In Belgium, immigrants who lose jobs can receive almost two-thirds of their most recent wage in state benefits, which must make the hunt for a new job less urgent.

(5) None of these effects was large, but the study undermines the claim that immigrants steal jobs from natives or drag down their wages. Many immigrants take jobs that Americans do not want, the study finds. This "smooths" the labor market and ultimately creates more jobs for locals. Native-owned grocery stores do better business because there are immigrants to pick the fruit they sell. Indian computer scientists help American software firms expand. A previous study found that because immigrants typically earn less than locals with similar skills, they boost corporate profits, prompting companies to grow and hire more locals.

[A] cautiously favorable
[B] slightly negative
[C] strongly negative

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) There was something in the elderly woman's behavior that caught my eye. Although slow gestures, and unsure of step the woman moved with deliberation, and there was no hesitation in her gestures. She was as good as anyone else, her movements suggested. And she had a job to do.

(2) It was a few years ago, and I had taken a part-time holiday-season job in a video store at the local shopping mall. From inside the store, I'd begun to see the people rushing by outside in the mall's concourse as a river of humanity.

(3) The elderly woman had walked into the store along with a younger woman who guessed was her daughter. The daughter was displaying a serious case of impatience, rolling her eyes, huffing and sighing, checking her watch every few seconds. If she had possessed a leash, her mother would have been fastened to it as a means of tugging her along to keep step with the rush of other shoppers.

(4) The older woman detached from the younger one and began to tick through the DVDs on the nearest shelf. After the slightest hesitation, I walked over and asked if I could help her find something. The woman smiled up at me and showed me a title scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper. The title was unusual and a bit obscure. Clearly a person looking for it knew a little about movies, about quality.

(5) Rather than rushing off to locate the DVD for the woman, I asked her to walk with me so I could show her where she could find it. Looking back, I think I wanted to enjoy her company for a moment. Something about her deliberate movements reminded me of my own mother, who'd passed away the previous Christmas.

(6) As we walked along the back of the store, I narrated its floor plan: old television shows, action movies, cartoons, science fiction. The woman seemed glad of the unrushed company and casual conversation.

(7) We found the movie, and I complimented her on her choice. She smiled and told me it was one she'd enjoyed when she was her son's age and that she hoped he would enjoy it as much as she had. Maybe, she said with a hint of wistfulness he could enjoy it with his own young children. Then, reluctantly, I had to return the elderly woman to her keeper, who was still tapping her foot at the front of the store.

(8) I escorted the older woman to the queue at the cash register and then stepped back and lingered near the younger woman. When the older woman's turn in line came, she paid in cash, counting out the dollars and coins with the same sureness she'd displayed earlier.

(9) As the cashier tucked the DVD into a plastic bag, I walked over to the younger woman.

(10) "Is that your mom?" I asked.

(11) I halfway expected her to tell me it was none of my business. But possibly believing me to be tolerant of her impatience, she rolled her eyes and said, "Yeah." There was exasperation in her reply, half sigh and half groan.

(12) Still watching the mother, I said, "Mind some advice?"

(13) "Sure," said the daughter.

(14) I smiled to show her I wasn't criticizing. "Cherish her," I said. And then I answered her curious expression by saying, "When she's gone, it's the little moments that'll come back to you. Moments like this. I know."

(15) It was true. I missed my mom still and remembered with melancholy clarity the moments when I'd used my impatience to make her life miserable.

(16) The elderly woman moved with her deliberate slowness back to her daughter's custody. Together they made their way toward the store's exit. They stood there for a moment, side by side, watching the rush of the holiday current and for their place in it. Then the daughter glanced over and momentarily regarded her mother. And slowly, almost reluctantly, she placed her arm with apparently unaccustomed affection around her mother's shoulders and gently guided her back into the crowds.

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) Reading award-winning literature may boost your ability to read other people, a new study suggests. Researchers at the New School for Social Research, in New York City, found that when they had volunteers read works of acclaimed "literary fiction", it seemed to temporarily improve their ability to interpret other people's emotions. The same was not true of nonfiction or "popular" fiction, the mystery, romance and science-fiction books that often dominate bestseller lists.

(2) Experts said the findings, reported online in *Science*, suggest that literature might help people to be more perceptive and engaged in their lives.

(3) "Reading literary fiction isn't just for passing the time. It's not just an escape," said Keith Oatley, a professor emeritus of cognitive psychology at the University of Toronto. It also enables us to better understand others, and then take that into our daily lives.

(4) Oatley was not involved in the new research, but worked on some of the first studies to suggest that reading literature can boost people's empathy for others. His team has found that those who read a lot of fiction tend to show greater empathy on standard tests, but the same is not true of avid nonfiction fans.

(5) But, the study by Oatley and his team cannot prove that literature boosts empathy—empathetic folks may just be drawn to reading fiction, whereas the new study does offer some "cause-and-effect" evidence, Oatley said. For the study, researchers set up a series of five experiments in which participants read either literary fiction, popular fiction, nonfiction or nothing at all before taking some standard tests. One of the tests is known as "Reading the Mind in the Eyes". People have to look at photos of actors' eyes, and then guess what emotion is being expressed in each. The test is considered a measure of empathy. Overall, study participants fared better on the test after reading literary fiction, versus the other three conditions.

(6) It was a small improvement, according to the principal researcher David Comer Kidd, "It's not like talking people from a (grade) 'C' to an 'A'," he said. But, Kidd added, the effect was seen after only about 10 minutes' reading, and it was a statistically strong finding, meaning it's unlikely to have been due to chance.

(7) "Literary" fiction has no hard-and-fast definition. So Kidd and his colleagues chose contemporary works that have won or been finalists for outstanding literary awards. They included "The Round House", by Louise Erdrich, "Salvage the Bones", by Jesmyn Ward and the short story "Corrie" by Alice Munro. And "popular" fiction included best-sellers like "Gone Girl" by Gillian Flynn, and Danielle Steel's "The Sins of the Mother".

(8) What's so special about literary fiction? "For one, it's usually more focused on characters than on plot," Kidd noted. But beyond that, he said, there is usually no single "authoritative narrator" who takes us through the story. "It demands that the reader almost become a writer and fill in the gaps. You really have to think about the characters," Kidd said.

(9) Oatley agreed. "Alice Munro doesn't tell you what to think," he said. "You, yourself, have to make inferences about characters. And that's often what we're doing in our real-life conversations." Or at least that's what people could do.

(10) Reading literary fiction could also offer a way to "practice" your social skills and use them more in real life, according to another researcher not involved in the study. "It's like how pilots train in a flight simulator," said Raymond Mar, an associate professor of psychology at York University, in Toronto, who has collaborated with Oatley. "This is a great study," Mar said of the new study. But he added that the overall research in this area is "still in its infancy" and one key question is whether literary fiction really is better than other fiction.

(11) Mar and his colleagues recently found that fans of romance novels tended to do best on tests of empathy. Unlike the current study, Mar's study did not test people after having them read different types of fiction. So it's possible that there is something else about romance-novel readers that makes them more understanding of others.

(12) Still, according to Mar, it's too early to tell people to trade in their Danielle Steel for Alice Munro, at least if the goal is boosting empathy.

(13) It's also possible that plays, movies or even TV shows could build your empathy muscles, according to Kidd. But reading may be special, he said, because it provides no visuals and you have to engage your imagination more.

(14) Everyone agreed that the findings suggest literature is important beyond entertainment or improving vocabulary. "There's a common belief that reading literature is frivolous, or not practical," Mar said. "But there's a growing body of evidence that it's important in skills that we need in our lives."

#### How much screen time is too much for kids?

Parents have been advised to limit media consumption of their children, but research suggests it's the nature of it that matters.

For many parents in the digital age, battles with their kids over screen time and devices have become a depressing part of family life. Many parents will now be relieved to hear that recent research suggests that it's not so much the length, but the nature of the screen time that matters.

Jocelyn Brewer, a psychologist who specializes in the concept of "digital nutrition", likens media diets to what's on our plates: rather than counting calories (or screen time), think about what you're eating.
"It's not just about whether you consume any potential digital junk foods, but also your relationship to technology and the role it plays in your family life," says Brewer.
For young children, the most important thing is whether parents and kids are playing, watching or browsing together.

A study of 20,000 parents published late last year by the Oxford Internet Institute and Cardiff University determined that there was no correlation between limiting device use and children's well-being. The study's lead author Dr Andrew Pryzbylski said: "Our findings suggest the broader family context—how parents set rules about digital screen time, and if they're actively engaged in exploring the digital world together, are more important than the raw screen time."
"The consensus is that screen time, in and of itself, is not harmful—and reasonable restrictions vary greatly, depending on a child's behavior and personality. There is little point in worrying about how many minutes a day your kids are spending with screens," says Brewer. "Instead, parents should be doing what they can to ensure that what they're watching, playing and reading is high-quality, age-appropriate and safe—and joining in wherever possible."

### PART IV: CLOZE

**[10 MIN]**

Decide which of the words given in the box below would complete the passage if inserted in the corresponding blanks. The words can be used **ONCE ONLY**. Mark the letter for each word on **ANSWER SHEET TWO**.

| A. actually     | B. cultural   | C. digitized | D. grammar | E. if         |
| :-------------- | :------------ | :----------- | :--------- | :------------ |
| F. intervention | G. obviously  | H. path      | I. though  | J. transition |
| K. transmission | L. unmediated | M. virtual   | N. visual  | O. way        |

There is a curious cliche that says pictures don't lie. It is part of that greater cliche that says seeing is believing. Somehow a thing seen directly—or through a(n) **(31) visual** representation like a painting, a photograph, or a film—brings us closer to some actual reality. Words are too **(32) cultural** not things themselves; words are made-up sounds, developed throughout the life of a culture, represented by made-up letters, put together in a contrived **(33) grammar** that everyone in a culture uses to communicate through a decision that the particular words will refer to particular things. Language is clearly **(34) cultural** and not natural: it is human-made and accepted with some variations throughout a particular culture. Every English speaker understands what the word "food" refers to, even **(35) though** the particular kind of food that comes to mind may vary to each individual. But seeing a thing seems to bring us something very close to the thing itself—to "reality". Things that are seen appear to be and even feel as if they are **(36) actually**; that is, they seem to be conveyed directly to us, not conveyed indirectly. Nothing stands in their **(37) way**. They are true.

But, in fact, an image, whether photographed, painted, or **(38) digitized**, is not the thing itself. It is a representation of a mediated **(39) visual**, composed through the camera lens, or a computer, and transferred onto film or through binary code onto the computer screen, appearing to be the thing itself. But even when we acknowledge the **(40) intervention** of optics, computer science, and the human hand and eye of the photographer in recording and developing the photographic image, we still haven't considered all the mediation that goes on. An image of the thing is not the thing.

#### SECTION A: MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS

---

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) As I write this, I have half an eye on an old James Bond film that is showing on my computer. But this is a story about how I stopped watching TV and began reading again for pleasure, after ten years in which I hardly turned a page.

(2) I suppose I was an avid reader of "literature" between the ages of nine and fourteen. I had enough time to be White Fang, Robinson Crusoe, and Bilbo Baggins and Jeeves. Of course there was room in the schoolboy's imagination for some real historical figures: Scott of the Antarctic, all of the Vikings, and Benjamin Franklin were good friends of mine.

(3) Then, in adolescence, I began a long search for strange and radical ideas. I wanted to challenge my elders and betters, and stir up my peers with amazing points of view. Of course, the only place to look was in books. I hunted out the longest titles and the authors with the funniest names, and scoured the library for completely unread books. Then I found one which became my bible for the whole of 1982. It had a title composed of eleven long words and an author whose name I didn't know how to pronounce. It was really thick and looked dead serious. Even better, it put forward a whole worldview that would take days to explain. Perfect. I took it out of the library three times, proud to see the date-stamps lined up on the empty library insert.

(4) Later, I went to university. Expecting to spend evenings in learned discussion with clever people, I started reading philosophy. For some reason I never found the deep-thinking intellectuals I hoped to meet. Anyway, I was ready to impress with my profound knowledge of post-structuralism and existentialism. These things are usually explained in rather short books, but they take a long time to get through. They were the end of my youthful reading.

(5) Working life was hard to get used to after so much theory. It was the end of books for me. There didn't seem to be much in books that would actually get things done. To do things you had to answer the telephone and work a computer. You had to travel about and speak to people who weren't at all interested in philosophy. I didn't stop reading, you can't avoid that. I read all day. But no books came my way, only manuals and pamphlets and contracts and documents. Maybe most people satisfy their need for stories and ideas with TV and, to tell the truth, it was all I needed for ten years. In those days I only had a book "on the go" for the duration of plane flights. At first I would come home and watch TV over dinner. Then, I moved the TV so I could watch it from bed. I even rigged up a switch so I could turn it off without getting out of bed. Then, one fateful day, my TV broke and my landlady took it away.

(6) My new TV is an extra circuit board inside my computer. It's on a desk in front of a working chair and I can't see it from the bed. I still use it for the weather forecasts and it's nice to have it on while I'm typing this ... but what to do last thing at night? Well, have another go with books.

(7) Now, I just like books. I have a pile of nice ones by my bed and I'm reading about six simultaneously. I don't want to be any of the characters. I don't care if a thousand people have already read them. I don't have to search through libraries. There are books everywhere and all of them have something to read in them. I have the strange feeling that they've been there all along, waiting for me to pick them up.

---

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) I was prepared to dislike Max Kelada even before I knew him. The war had just finished and the passenger traffic in the oceangoing liners was heavy. Accommodation was very hard to get and you had to put up with whatever the agents chose to offer you. You could not hope for a cabin to yourself and I was thankful to be given one in which there were only two berths. But when I was told the name of my companion my heart sank. It suggested closed portholes and the night air rigidly excluded. It was bad enough to share a cabin for fourteen days with anyone, but I should have looked upon it with less dismay if my fellow passenger's name had been Smith or Brown.

(2) When I went on board I found Mr. Kelada's luggage already below. I did not like the look of it; there were too many labels on the suitcases. And the wardrobe trunk was too big. He had unpacked his toilet things, and I observed that he was a patron of the excellent Monsieur Coty. I did not at all like Mr. Kelada. I made my way into the smoking room. I called for a pack of cards and began to play. I had scarcely started before a man came up to me and asked me if he was right in thinking my name was so and so.

(3) "I am Mr. Kelada," he added, with a smile that showed a row of flashing teeth, and sat down.

(4) "Oh, yes, we're sharing a cabin, I think."

(5) "Bit of luck, I call it. You never know whom you're going to be put in with. I was jolly glad when I heard you were English. I'm all for us English sticking together when we're abroad, if you understand what I mean."

(6) I blinked.

(7) "Are you English?" I asked, perhaps tactlessly.

(8) "Rather. You don't think I look like an American, do you? British to the backbone, that's what I am."

(9) To prove it, Mr. Kelada took out of his pocket a passport and airily waved it under my nose.

(10) Mr. Kelada was short and of a sturdy build, clean shaven and dark skinned, with a fleshy, hooked nose and very large, lustrous and liquid eyes. His long black hair was sleek and curly. He spoke with a fluency in which there was nothing English and his gestures were exuberant. I felt pretty sure that a closer inspection of that British passport would have betrayed the fact that Mr. Kelada was born under a bluer sky than is generally seen in England.

(11) "What will you have?" he asked me.

(12) I looked at him doubtfully. Prohibition was in force and to all appearance the ship was bone dry. When I am not thirsty I do not know which I dislike more, ginger ale or lemon squash. But Mr. Kelada flashed an oriental smile at me.

(13) "Whisky and soda or a dry martini, you have only to say the word."

(14) From each of his hip pockets he fished a flask and laid it on the table before me. I chose the martini, and calling the steward he ordered a tumbler of ice and a couple of glasses.

(15) "A very good cocktail," I said.

(16) "Well, there are plenty more where that came from, and if you've got any friends on board, you tell them you've got a pal who's got all the liquor in the world."

(17) Mr. Kelada was chatty. He talked of New York and of San Francisco. He discussed plays, pictures, and politics. I do not wish to put on airs, but I cannot help feeling that it is seemly in a total stranger to put *mister* before my name when he addresses me. Mr. Kelada, doubtless to set me at my ease, used no such formality. I did not like Mr. Kelada. I had put aside the cards when he sat down, but now, thinking that for this first occasion our conversation had lasted long enough, I went on with my game.

---

44. We can infer from the passage that Mr. Kelada's attitude towards the author is **enthusiastic**.
A. neutral
B. enthusiastic
C. biased
D. unfriendly

45. The author did not like Mr. Kelada for the following reasons **EXCEPT** **his scope of knowledge**.
A. his oversized wardrobe trunk
B. his dubious British descent

D. his scope of knowledge

46. Which of the following might be the best title of the passage?
A. An Unforgettable Journey.
B. An Interesting Conversation.
C. An Irritating Companion.
D. An Accidental Encounter.

---

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) One of our most firmly entrenched ideas of masculinity is that a real man doesn't cry. Although he might shed a discreet tear at a funeral, he's expected to quickly regain control. Sobbing openly is for girls.

(2) This isn't just a social expectation. One study found that women report crying significantly more than men do—five times as often, on average, and almost twice as long per episode.

(3) So it's perhaps surprising to learn that the gender gap in crying seems to be a recent development. Historically, men routinely wept, and no one saw it as feminine or shameful.

(4) For example, in chronicles of the Middle Ages, we find one ambassador repeatedly bursting into tears when addressing Philip the Good, and the entire audience at a peace congress throwing themselves on the ground, sobbing and groaning as they listen to the speeches. In medieval romances, knights cried purely because they missed their girlfriends. In Chretien de Troyes's *Lancelot, or, The Knight of the Cart*, no less a hero than Lancelot weeps at a brief separation from Guinevere. At another point, he cries on a lady's shoulder at the thought that he won't get to go to a big tournament because of his captivity. What's more, instead of being disgusted by this sniveling, the lady is moved to help.

(5) There's no mention of the men in these stories trying to restrain or hide their tears. No one pretends to have something in his eye. No one makes an excuse to leave the room. They cry in a crowded hall with their heads held high. Nor do their companions make fun of this public blubbering; it's universally regarded as an admirable expression of feeling.

(6) So where did all the male tears go? There was no anti-crying movement. No leaders of church or state introduced measures to discourage them. Nevertheless, by the Romantic period, masculine tears were reserved for poets. From there, it was just a short leap to the poker-faced heroes of Ernest Hemingway, who, despite their poetic leanings, could not express grief by any means but drinking and shooting the occasional buffalo.

(7) The most obvious possibility is that this shift is the result of changes that took place as we moved from a feudal agrarian society to one that was urban and industrial. In the Middle Ages, most people spent their lives among those they had known since birth. A typical village had around 250 to 300 inhabitants, most of them related by blood or marriage. If men cried, they did so with people who would empathize.

(8) But from the 18th to 20th centuries, the population became increasingly urbanized, and people were living in the midst of thousands of strangers. Furthermore, changes in the economy required men to work together in factories and offices where emotional expression and even private conversation were discouraged as time wasting. As Tom Lutz writes in *Crying: The Natural and Cultural History of Tears*, "You don't want emotions interfering with the smooth running of things."

(9) Yet human beings weren't designed to swallow their emotions, and there's reason to believe that suppressing tears can be hazardous to your well-being. Research from the 1980s has suggested a relationship between stress-related illnesses and inadequate crying. Weeping is also, somewhat counterintuitively, correlated with happiness and wealth. Countries where people cry the most tend to be more democratic and their populations more extroverted.

(10) It's time to open the floodgates. Time for men to give up emulating the stone-faced heroes of action movies and be more like the emotive heroes of Homer, like the weeping kings, saints, and statesmen of thousands of years of human history. When misfortune strikes, let us all—men and women—join together and cry until our sleeves are drenched. As the Old Testament has it: "They that sow in tears shall reap in joy."

---

47. The examples in Para. 4 are cited to **provide supporting evidence for Para. 3**.
A. explain why men in the Middle Ages cried
B. provide supporting evidence for Para. 3
C. show similarity between now and then

B. Shift in expression of grief in fiction and poetry.
C. Changes in the attitude of their companions.
D. Measures introduced by church and state leaders.

49. Which of the following benefits of crying is the author **LESS sure about**?

D. Wealth.

50. What is the author's main message in the passage?

#### Loneliness and Wisdom: Are They Related?

Rising rates of loneliness may not be news, but the three periods when it peaks may come as a surprise: More people reported feeling moderate to severe loneliness during their late 20s, their mid-50s and their late 80s than in other life periods, according to the research published in the journal *International Psychogeriatrics*.

The general sense of isolation was also more prevalent than the researchers had expected. A full three-quarters of the study participants reported moderate to high levels of loneliness, said Dr. Philip Jeste, senior author of the study and a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego.
"One thing to remember is that loneliness is subjective. Loneliness does not mean being alone; loneliness does not mean not having friends," said Dr. Jeste, who is also director at the UC San Diego's Center for Healthy Aging, "Loneliness is defined as 'subjective distress.' It is the discrepancy between the social relationships you want and the social relationships you have, he said.

Within the dark clouds, Dr. Jeste also found a silver lining: An inverse relationship exists between loneliness and wisdom. "In other words, people who have high levels of wisdom didn't feel lonely, and vice versa," he said.

### PART IV: CLOZE

**[10 MIN]**

Decide which of the words given in the box below would best complete the passage if inserted in the corresponding blank. The words can be used **ONCE ONLY**. Mark the letter for each word on **ANSWER SHEET TWO**.

| A. aesthetic | B. assimilation | C. being        | D. even  | E. face       |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| F. having    | G. objective    | H. overwhelming | I. still | J. strategies |
| K. towards   | L. upon         | M. wake         | N. ways  | O. yet        |

Reality is always a mutually agreed-upon social construct, a more or less common consensus about what is out there and what it all means to most people. Our shared ideas of truth, beauty, morality, politics, and the **(31) ways** we interpret the world and make decisions on how we act in it are determined by a complex process of education, **(32) assimilation**, acculturation, and assent that begins at birth. It is a cliché that human beings are out of touch with nature, and that more than a few of us are out of touch with reality. The fact is, **(33) even** when we are in touch, it's not with some given natural world or some **(34) objective** existing reality. Being in touch with nature means acting **(35) upon** learned response to the natural world. As a matter of fact, responding with awe in the **(36) face** of natural beauty dates back only to the eighteenth century and became a major cultural event only in the nineteenth century. Before the late seventeenth century, people in Western Europe did not pay much attention to nature's grandeur. A mountain range was something in the way. A complex shift in sociological and **(37) aesthetic** responses occurred in the early eighteenth century and can be traced in its development through travel literature and then in poetry, fiction, and philosophy. By the mid-eighteenth century, wild, mountainous landscapes became the site of grand, **(38) overwhelming** emotional response. The mountains had not, themselves, changed; cultural response had. The "Sublime", the effect of **(39) being** transported before nature's wildness and in front of representations of that wildness in painting and poetry, was born. With it came nineteenth-century romanticism and attitudes toward the natural world that **(40) still** remain with us. Reality is not an objective, geophysical phenomenon like a mountain. Reality is always something said or understood about the world.

#### SECTION A: MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

In this section there are three passages followed by ten multiple choice questions. For each multiple choice question, there are four suggested answers marked **A, B, C,** and **D**. Choose the one that you think is the best answer and mark your answers on **ANSWER SHEET TWO**.

------

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) We didn't always live on Mango Street. Before that we lived on Loomis on the third floor, and before that we lived on Keeler. Before Keeler it was Paulina, and before that I can't remember. But what I remember most is moving a lot. Each time it seemed there'd be one more of us. By the time we got to Mango Street we were six—Mama, Papa, Carlos, Kiki, my sister Nenny and me.

(2) The house on Mango Street is ours, and we don't have to pay rent to anybody, or share the yard with the people downstairs, or be careful not to make too much noise, and there isn't a landlord banging on the ceiling with a broom. But even so, it's not the house we'd thought we'd get.

(3) We had to leave the flat on Loomis quick. The water pipes broke and the landlord wouldn't fix them because the house was too old. We had to leave fast. We were using the washroom next door and carrying water over in empty milk gallons. That's why Mama and Papa looked for a house, and that's why we moved into the house on Mango Street, far away, on the other side of town.

(4) They always told us that one day we would move into a house, a real house that would be ours for always so we wouldn't have to move each year. And our house would have running water and pipes that worked. And inside it would have real stairs, not hallway stairs, but stairs inside like the houses on TV. And we'd have a basement and at least three washrooms so when we took a bath we wouldn't have to tell everybody. Our house would be white with trees around it, a great big yard and grass growing without a fence. This was the house Papa talked about when he held a lottery ticket and this was the house Mama dreamed up in the stories she told us before we went to bed.

(5) But the house on Mango Street is not the way they told it at all. It's small and red with tight steps in front and windows so small you'd think they were holding their breath. Bricks are crumbling in places, and the front door is so swollen you have to push hard to get in. There is no front yard, only four little elms the city planted by the curb. Our back is a small garage for the car we don't own yet and a small yard that looks smaller between the two buildings on either side. There are stairs in our house, but they're ordinary hallway stairs, and the house has only one washroom. Everybody has to share a bedroom—Mama and Papa, Carlos and Kiki, me and Nenny.

(6) Once when we were living on Loomis, a nun from my school passed by and saw me playing out front. The laundromat downstairs had been boarded up because it had been robbed two days before and the owner had painted on the wood YES WE'RE OPEN so as not to lose business.

(7) "Where do you live?" she asked.

(8) "There," I said pointing up to the third floor.

(9) "You live there?"

(10) "There." I had to look to where she pointed—the third floor, the paint peeling, wooden bars Papa had nailed on the windows so we wouldn't fall out. "You live there?" The way she said it made me feel like nothing. There. I lived there. I nodded.

(11) I knew then I had to have a house. A real house. One I could point to. But this isn't it. The house on Mango Street isn't it. For the time being, Mama says. Temporary, says Papa. But I know how those things go.

1. The size of the family **grew** each time they moved house. A. grew B. shrank C. fluctuated D. stayed the same
2. Which of the following does **NOT** fit the description of the family's dream house (Para. 4)? A. Spaciousness. B. Convenience. C. Quietness. D. Comfort.
3. The narrator's dream house and the house on Mango Street are compared in the following details **EXCEPT** **garage**. A. garage B. size C. stairs D. yard

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) Thanksgiving may be an official day of gratitude in the U.S., but research suggests that if you make time for "thank you" every day, you might enjoy life more.

(2) Many people may think of gratitude as a "passive" gesture—you wait for something good, then feel grateful, said David DeSteno, a professor of psychology at Northeastern University. DeSteno studies the effects that thankfulness can have on people's behavior.

(3) But a growing body of research is suggesting the opposite is true, according to DeSteno. By choosing to feel gratitude, people can make positive changes in their lives. "Gratitude isn't passive reflection. It's active," DeSteno said. "And it's not about the past. It's there to help direct our behavior in the future."

(4) In experiments where he and his colleagues set people up to feel grateful, they found that thankfulness appeared to spur participants to act in more cooperative, less selfish ways. In one study, for example, people came to the lab to complete a computer task. At some point, certain participants' computers were rigged to "crash". Luckily, a kind stranger who had just completed the same task (and was actually part of the research team) offered help and got the computer running again. Afterward, all of the study participants played a standard economic game where people have the opportunity to either act strictly in their own self-interest or in a more cooperative way.

(5) In general, DeSteno's team found, the study participants who had gotten help from a stranger during that first test were more likely to be cooperative during the next test. (A survey all of the participants took confirmed that those who'd received help were, in fact, feeling more grateful than their counterparts who'd had smooth sailing.) That's one of a number of studies, DeSteno said, that suggest that gratitude helps guide behavior. It can encourage you to get more exercise, or to be more helpful to others (and not just that person you feel you "owe").

(6) Some research has also found links between gratitude and better health, such as lower blood pressure and just feeling physically better. However, it's not clear whether gratitude directly affects physical well-being.

(7) At the University of California, Professor Naomi Eisenberger and her colleagues hope to zero in a bit more on the effects of gratitude. For six weeks, some study participants will spend time writing about things for which they are grateful. The rest will write about positive subjects, but won't focus on gratitude.

(8) According to Eisenberger, gratitude, based on studies like DeSteno's, seems to enhance people's ability to care for others. And in animals, Eisenberger noted, caregiving is linked to lesser reactivity in the face of a threat—mothers may feel less scared for themselves when a predator comes, and protect their babies instead.

(9) Whatever the biological effects, plenty of research suggests that gratitude can change how you feel—even about those people who've been in your life for years, according to Sara Algoe, an assistant professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina.

(10) Her research has focused on the effects of gratitude in romantic relationships. In one study of 77 couples who'd been together for an average of four years, Algoe's team had each partner think of something the other had done for them recently—no matter how small—and then thank him or her. Before that task, the couples completed a survey on their satisfaction with their relationship. Then they did it again six months later.

(11) In general, the study saw a shift in people who felt their partner really meant that "thank you"—thinking, for example, that "my partner saw the 'real' me." Those men and women typically felt more satisfied with their relationship six months later. The findings, according to Algoe, highlight the importance of saying "thank you" even for those mundane things, from those people you see every day.

(12) "Expressing gratitude well is a potent part of relationship satisfaction," Algoe said. "Sometimes we feel grateful, but we don't say it. This research suggests it's important to say it. And if someone offers you help, try accepting it instead of shunning it. See it as a gift."

1. Which of the following statements about gratitude does Professor DeSteno most likely agree? A. It is passive and personal. B. It can direct one's future behavior. C. It can help one accomplish a task. D. It is about what help one gets from others.
2. Which of the following is **NOT** mentioned as a potential benefit of gratitude? A. Better mental well-being. B. Improved physical health. C. Tendency to care for others. D. Higher relationship satisfaction.
3. According to the passage, one similarity between DeSteno's and Algoe's research lies in **their research objectives**. A. the number of their participants B. the task types for their participants C. their research objectives D. their research procedures
4. What is the main topic of the passage? A. Effects of gratitude. B. Categories of gratitude. C. Gratitude and marriage. D. Gratitude and cooperation.

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) As words fall in and out of fashion, new ones enter the language. But some, such as autonaut, chassimover and pupamotor failed to reach the assembly line.

(2) English is a marvelous mashup of words. A few Celtic place names. A stock of Old English words (day and night, black and white, food and drink). More than twice as many words adopted from Norman French (marriage, parliament). Sometimes competing words from both: motherhood (Old English) and maternity (Norman French). Words of Greek derivation, like octopus. Words of Latin derivation, such as campus and ultimatum. Words from all over the place: Welsh (corgi), Irish (brogues), Arabic (algebra), German (hamster), Chinese (typhoon), Japanese (tycoon), American Indian (tobacco), and many more.

(3) Wherever they come from, words fall in and out of fashion. Within living memory some words have changed meanings completely, while bad and wicked changed, then changed back. Yesterday's slang is respectable today. In the 1950s and 60s, words that angered people who write to newspapers included job (the writer thought it vulgar, and preferred employment), and breakdown ("horrible jargon"). The Manchester Guardian stylebook of 1950 banned such "slang" phrases as bank on, face up to, give away, sack (for "dismiss") and many others.

(4) The expression "foregone conclusion" once meant an experience previously undergone, rather than making a decision without listening to the arguments. Many words we use today have a different meaning from 20, never mind 50,100 or 200 years ago. The word "nice" once meant silly (silly meant happy or blessed), then subtle, then pleasant. You could be sad with food and drink—it meant full to the brim, and was related to satisfied and saturated. It then came to mean solid, so a reliable person could be called sad; in time, solid, heavy and dull came to mean sad in one of our modern uses. In recent years it subtly acquired an additional meaning, as in "how sad is that?"

(5) About 1,700 words are first recorded in Shakespeare (which does not necessarily mean he invented them), including barefaced, fancy-free, laughable and submerged. Milton is credited with the expression "all ears". Jung invented the word synchronicity as well as ambivalent, extrovert and introvert, while Freud came up with the word psychoanalysis, which is derived from the Greek for butterfly, psyche, who was also the Greek goddess of the soul.

(6) There is another continual source of new words. The man who developed Bluetooth in 1996 was reading a historical novel about Harald Bluetooth, a 10th-century King of Denmark, at the time and appropriated his name. Spam, in the sense of unwanted emails, was named after the 1970 Monty Python cafe sketch in which Spam, in the sense of unwanted canned meat, was compulsory in every dish. Sometimes new words catch on, sometimes they don't, but you can always bet that someone, somewhere will object to them. I recall readers complaining about the Guardian's use of the new word blog (an abbreviation of another new word, weblog) but within a very short time it had become established. In the early 1960s, the Automobile Association sought suggestions from the public for a new word to describe drivers: submissions included autocarist, autonaut, chassimover, motorman, wheelist, and the bizarre acronym pupamotor ("person using power-assisted means of travelling on roads"). The idea was dropped. Whoever came up with laser ("light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation") in 1960 was more successful.

(7) The writer A. P. Herbert devised a scoring system for new words, which would be given marks out of 10 on each of four criteria: is it readily understood, is it to be admired, is it sound etymologically, and is it actually required? The pass mark was 50% and television, for example, just scraped through (scoring respectively 10,0,0, and 10). One of my favorite recent words is bouncebackability, a neat alternative to "the ability to bounce back" attributed to the former football manager Iain Dowie. I fear it would fail the test.

1. What does the word **mashup** (Para. 2) mean according to the context? A. Composition. B. Mixture. C. Variation. D. Structure.
2. What is the shared theme of Paras. 3 and 4? A. New use of slang phrases. B. Origins of words and slangs. C. Latest trend of word use. D. Changes in word meaning.
3. From Paras. 5 and 6, we know that words were coined in the following areas **EXCEPT** **medicine**. A. psychology B. literature C. medicine D. technology

#### Loneliness and Wisdom: Are They Related?

Rising rates of loneliness may not be news, but the three periods when it peaks may come as a surprise: More people reported feeling moderate to severe loneliness during their late 20s, their mid-50s and their late 80s than in other life periods, according to the research published in the journal *International Psychogeriatrics*.

The general sense of isolation was also more prevalent than the researchers had expected. A full three-quarters of the study participants reported moderate to high levels of loneliness, said Dr. Philip Jeste, senior author of the study and a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego. "One thing to remember is that loneliness is subjective. Loneliness does not mean being alone; loneliness does not mean not having friends," said Dr. Jeste, who is also director at the UC San Diego's Center for Healthy Aging, "Loneliness is defined as 'subjective distress.' It is the discrepancy between the social relationships you want and the social relationships you have, he said.

Within the dark clouds, Dr. Jeste also found a silver lining: An inverse relationship exists between loneliness and wisdom. "In other words, people who have high levels of wisdom didn't feel lonely, and vice versa," he said.

### 2022 年专四真题详解

------

#### PART III: LANGUAGE USAGE

1. **should notice**

- **解析**: 考查虚拟语气。should型虚拟语法能用于由if、though、whatever、lest、so long as等引导的分句中，表示推测、让步、防备等含义。lest表示"免得"，谓语动词要用虚拟语气，即"(should+)动词原形"。故选D项。

1. **in the face**

- **解析**: 在句型"动词+sb.+介词+the+身体部位"中，要用定冠词 the，而不用人称代词。常见的这类动词有 take、catch、hold、pull、hit、pat、seize、lead等，常用的介词有in、on、by。故选A项。

1. **could have**

- **解析**: 考查虚拟语气。前面 used the highest quality paper... and turned out far fewer volumes是过去真实的情况，than后 otherwise 从句是对过去的虚拟，otherwise相当于if not，表示"如果不是（这样的话）"，这是对过去的虚拟，故相当于if he hadn't used... he 。对过去的虚拟，主句应用 would/could/might/should+have done，谓语部分和主句重复，故可省略为 could have（turned out... volumes）。故选C项。

1. **as**

- **解析**: 考查"as+助动词+主语"的倒装。as是从属连词，引导方式状语从句，意思是"像……一样"。本句相当于 as economic growth accompanied by... kept rising。as引导的句子也可以不倒装，但本句由于主语过长，为避免头重脚轻，用了部分倒装。故选B项。

1. **to be scanned**

- **解析**: 考查 to be done的用法。由 In the coming years可知，句中提到的事情还未发生。而空格处填入的内容在句中作定语，修饰search area，这些区域是"被"扫描，且是表示将来的动作，因此要用不定式的将来被动式，即 to be scanned。故选D项。

1. **women athletes**

- **解析**: 考查名词修饰名词的结构。空格要表达的是 "女运动员（们）"，语序上应该 "女" 在前，"运动员"在后。此外，名词修饰名词，一般情况下，前一个名词要用单数形式（如a bus driver，bus drivers），但当第一个名词是 man 或 woman 时，所修饰的名词是复数时，man 或 woman 也要用复数 men 或 women，如a man driver，men drivers。本句athletes要用复数，故应用 women，B项正确。

1. **from excessive reading**

- **解析**: 考查状语和主句之间的关系。A项"由于过度阅读"表原因，故选A项。B项"尽管她付出了种种努力"表让步；C项"为了你的父母"表目的；D项"和琳达一样好"表比较。

1. **tentativeness**

- **解析**: 考查一般过去时的用法。句中画线部分 could 和suited 均为一般过去时，但从句意看，说的是将来的事（据此可排除B项）。一般过去时在特定的句型中，可表示现在和将来的时间，表示委婉语气或试探语气（想象性的用法），故选C项。句中的 could 不等同于 be able to，不表示"能力"，故排除A项。一般过去时表示主观设想(hypothesis) 时，一般用在it is time, I wish(I wish you lived closer to us.) 或if的句型里（If you went at about five o'clock tomorrow, you could see him before he left the office.),故排除D项。

1. **explain an intended purpose**

- **解析**: 考查非限制性定语从句。which引导非限制性定语从句，修饰interview，从语义上看，说明的是"我"在得到一次面试机会后所做的行为，故选C项。A项"解释要达到的目的"与句意不符，发申请书的目的不是为了拒绝面试。由于which引导非限制性定语从句，其作用是补充说明（该信息是非必要的，与限制性定语从句不同），不能起到 "限制"（restrict）或下定义（define）的作用，故排除B、D两项。

1. **C. As the content is banal, it is easy to dismiss it as beneath serious consideration.**

- **解析**: 考查介词beneath。beneath 作介词，本义是in or to a lower position than someone or something，即"在（或往） ⋯⋯⋯⋯ 下方"。A项"X光技术发现画下还藏着一幅肖像"、B项"周四凌展 3 点左右，铁轨下方出现了一个洞"，D项"洋底下方形成的岩石可能是游离氢气的来源"，这三项用的都是 beneath 的本义，表示方位的 "下方"。C项"由于内容平庸，很容易认为它缺乏认真考虑"中的 beneath 表示 not good enough for...，引申为 "没有，缺乏"，故选C项。

1. **prevailing**

- **解析**: 考查词义辨析。A项prevailing和B项prevalent为近义词，都有"流行的，盛行的"的意思。其中， prevalent强调某事物在某一地方或时间普遍或普见（exists or is very common at a particular time or in a particular place），而prevailing则更进一步，指在特定时间或地方最盛行或普遍的，强调与同类相比最占优势或占支配地位 (things observed has existed and continues to exist in such quantity as to surpass any other kind of thing that might be compared to it），一般指客观评价，本句强调的是目前最主流的结论，故A项更合适。C项persuasive 表示"有说服力的"；D项popular表示"讨人喜欢的"。

1. **samples**

- **解析**: 考查近义词的词义辨析。A项 samples 表示"样本"，指可以用于研究观察以了解整体情况的"例子" (something that is physically present for inspection as a representative of some larger entity), 符合生态学家(Ecologists)采本的目的。B项 collections 表示因个人兴趣而积累的"收藏品"；C项 examples 表示"例子"，语义宽泛，常强调示范作用；D项selections表示"挑选出来的东西"。

1. **evicted**

- **解析**: 考查近义词的词义辨析。A项evicted表示"(依法从房屋里或土地上)驱逐，赶出"；B项revoked表示"撤销，取消"；C项 evacuated表示"(从危险的地方)撤出"；D项rejected表示"拒绝"。根据词义和句义，可排除B、 C、D三项。

1. **precedent**

- **解析**: 考查固定搭配。without precedent为固定搭配，表示 "史无前例"，符合句意，故选C项。A项 predecessor表示"前任；前身"；B项 premise表示"前提"；D项 preference表示 "偏爱"。

1. **displaced**

- **解析**: 考查词义辨析。A项misplaced表示"错位"；B项displaced表示"迫使（某人）离开家园"；C项replaced表示"取代"；D项placed表示"放置"。根据句中的refugee"难民"可推出选B项。

1. **refrains**

- **解析**: 考查词义辨析和常用句式。由Few are spared from suffering"很少有人能免受痛苦" 可知，作者是没有给出圆满的结局的。A项strains表示"拉紧；用尽全力"，明显不合语境。B项restrains表示"抑制"，表示抑制自己时，常用结构是restrain oneself；表示阻止他人做某事时，常用结构是restrain sb. from doing sth.。C项constrains表示"约束，限制"，常用结构是constrain sb. from doing sth.，表示阻止某人做某事。 D项refrains表示 "克制"，常用结构是refrain from doing sth.，可表示某人自己克制做某事。空格后只有 from offering...，因此选D项。

1. **compelling**

- **解析**: 考查形近词的词义辨析。A项expelling表示"驱逐"；B项dispelling表示"驱散"；C项impelling表示"敦促"；D项compelling作形容词，表示"引人入胜的"，可以修饰 tale，且与空格前的haunting语义相近，故选D项。A、B、C三项均为动词的现在分词，语义也不符，均可排除。

1. **other**

- **解析**: 考查固定搭配。A项rather than表示"而不是"；B项other than表示"除……以外"；C项more than表示"超过"；D项different than表示"不同于"。根据句意可推出选B项。

1. **critically**

- **解析**: 考查词义辨析。结合文化常识，"伤员"和"深夜袭击营地"对人类社会的影响应该是深远的、积极正面的。A项vehemently表示"激烈地"；B项periodically表示"定期地"；C项enormously表示"庞大地"。只有D项critically表示"严重地"，用来说明伤员的伤势，符合语境，故选D项。

1. **profound**

- **解析**: 考查词义辨析。结合文化常识，"印刷机"和"大规模印刷"对人类社会的影响应该是深远的、积极正面的。A项escalating是动词escalate的现在分词，表示"(使)逐步升级"，不符合语境。B项grave表示"严重的，严峻的"，语义色彩是消极负面的，也不选。D项in-depth表示"深入的，详尽的，彻底的"，一般用于修饰调查报告、研究、讨论和采访等。只有C项profound表示"深远的"，用来说明 cultural effects最合适。

#### PART IV: CLOZE

#### Reality

Reality is always a mutually agreed-upon social construct, a more or less common consensus about what is out there and what it all means to most people. Our shared ideas of truth, beauty, morality, politics, and the **(31) ways** we interpret the world and make decisions on how we act in it are determined by a complex process of education, **(32) assimilation**, acculturation, and assent that begins at birth. It is a cliché that human beings are out of touch with nature, and that more than a few of us are out of touch with reality. The fact is, **(33) even** when we are in touch, it's not with some given natural world or some **(34) objective** existing reality. Being in touch with nature means acting **(35) upon** learned response to the natural world. As a matter of fact, responding with awe in the **(36) face** of natural beauty dates back only to the eighteenth century and became a major cultural event only in the nineteenth century. Before the late seventeenth century, people in Western Europe did not pay much attention to nature's grandeur. A mountain range was something in the way. A complex shift in sociological and **(37) aesthetic** responses occurred in the early eighteenth century and can be traced in its development through travel literature and then in poetry, fiction, and philosophy. By the mid-eighteenth century, wild, mountainous landscapes became the site of grand, **(38) overwhelming** emotional response. The mountains had not, themselves, changed; cultural response had. The "Sublime", the effect of **(39) being** transported before nature's wildness and in front of representations of that wildness in painting and poetry, was born. With it came nineteenth-century romanticism and attitudes toward the natural world that **(40) still** remain with us. Reality is not an objective, geophysical phenomenon like a mountain. Reality is always something said or understood about the world.

### SECTION A: MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

------

#### PASSAGE ONE

1. **A. grew**

- **解析**: 本题问每次搬家后，作者的家庭规模有什么改变。第 1 段倒数第 2 句提到，每次搬家，家里就增加一人 (one more of us)，也就是说，每次搬家后，家庭规模会增加，对应 A项"增长"。

1. **C. Quietness.**

- **解析**: 本题问哪一项描述与文中所述梦想中的房子不符。第4段第2-5句描述了梦想中的房子：有真正的楼梯、地下室、至少三个卫生间、大院子(a great big yard), 可以看出房子是大的; 而第5段第2-6句提到

了芒果街上的房子的面积小(It's small), 脸子小(a small yard), 还只有普通的门厅台阶(ordinary hallway stairs)。由此可见，作者对房子的大小、院子、楼梯都进行了比较。文中只有在描述芒果街上的房子时提及了车库（第5段第5句），没有描述梦想中房子的车库，故选A项"车库"。

1. **D. yard.**

- **解析**: 本题问作者在比较梦想中的房子和芒果街上的房子时，没有比较哪个细节。第4段第3-5句提到，梦想中的房子有真正的楼梯 (real stairs), 地下室、至少三个卫生间、大院子(a great big yard), 可以看出房子是大的; 而第5段第2-6句提到

了芒果街上的房子的面积小(It's small), 脸子小(a small yard), 还只有普通的门厅台阶(ordinary hallway stairs)。由此可见，作者对房子的大小、院子、楼梯都进行了比较。文中只有在描述芒果街上的房子时提及了车库（第5段第5句），没有描述梦想中房子的车库，故选A项"车库"。

#### PASSAGE TWO

1. **B. It can direct one's future behavior.**

- **解析**: 本题问德斯迪诺教授对感恩的看法。第3段最后一句概括了德斯迪诺的研究角度：感恩对人们行为的影响。第3段最后一句提到，感恩指导我们未来的行为(direct our behavior in the future)。B项中 direct复现原文关键词，future behavior是对原文behavior in the future的同义改写，故选B项"它可以指导人们未来的行为"。

1. **A. Better mental well-being.**

- **解析**: 本题问哪一项不属于感恩的潜在好处。第 5 段最后两句提到感恩有助于引导行为，能促使人们多加锻炼，促使人们更加乐于助人（而不仅仅是帮助自己觉得"亏大"的人）。第6段第1句提到感恩与健康存在关联，如血压降低和身体感觉更好。第8段第1句提到感恩似乎能提高自己关心他人的能力。第11段提到研究中得到伴侣感谢的男女对夫妻关系感到更满意。由此可知，A项"更好的心理健康"没有原文依据，故为答案。

1. **C. their research objectives.**

- **解析**: 本题问德斯迪诺和阿尔戈研究的相似之处。第2段最后一句概括了德斯迪诺的研究角度：感恩对人们行为的影响。第10段第1句点明阿尔戈的研究重点：恋爱关系中感恩的影响。两人的研究对象都是gratitude，故选C项"其研究对象"。

1. **A. Effects of gratitude.**

- **解析**: 本题问文章的主题。文章第1-5段介绍德斯迪诺及其团队研究感恩对人们行为的影响，第6段提到一些研究发现感恩与健康存在关联，第7～8段讲艾森伯格教授及其同事也在关注感恩的影响，第 9～12段讲阿尔戈的研究重点——恋爱关系中感恩的影响，并得出结论：表达感激有助提高关系满意度。全文围绕感恩的影响展开，由此可知，A项"感恩的影响"是文章的主题。

------

#### PASSAGE THREE

1. **B. Mixture.**

- **解析**: 本题问 mashup 是什么意思。第 2 段第 1 句是该段的主题句，说明英语是一个词汇大杂烩，随后列举了英语词汇的各种来源。可见，a mashup of words指英语是一个词汇大杂烩，选项中与 mashup 意思最相近的是 mixture"混合体"，故选B项。

1. **D. Changes in word meaning.**

- **解析**: 本题问第 3.4 段的共同主题。第 3 段第 2 句指出，在人们的记忆中，有些词汇的意思完全改变了，而有些词汇经过一番大改后，又变了回来；第4段第2句指出，现在使用的许多词的意思与以前都不一样。随后举例说明某些词义的转变，包括一些俚语，以及nice、sad等词。因此，D项"词义的变化"为正确答案。

1. **C. medicine.**

- **解析**: 本题问哪项不是新词诞生的领域。第5.6段讲述多个领域的词汇来源。第5段前两句提到作家莎士比亚和弥尔顿；第3句提到心理学家荣格和弗洛伊德；第6段讲述了一些科技新词的创造过程。可见，只有 C 项"医学领域"没有在第 5.6 段提及，故选 C 项。

### SECTION B: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS

------

#### PASSAGE ONE

1. **It was too old to live in.**

- **解析**: 根据题干要求直接定位到第3段。本题问根据第3段的描述，可以对叙述者在鲁米斯街上的公寓作出什么样的推断。第3段第2句提到，鲁米斯街上的公寓水管破了，但房东却不肯修理，只因房子太过老旧，导致一家人需要靠借邻居的水过活（第3段第4句）。由此可推断，该房子过于老旧不适宜居住，故可答It was too old to live in。

1. **Their dream house is only a dream. // They can't own the house they dream of.**

- **解析**: 根据题干要求直接定位到第11段。"我"的父母都说现在住在芒果街上的这间小房子里只是暂时的（For the time being、Temporary），言下之意是，"我们"还是有可能住上梦想中的房子的。但此时 "我"话锋一转，指出 "我知道这些事情最后都会怎样"，那事情究竟会怎么样呢？文中的"我"其实深有体会：父母描绘着梦想中的房子（第4段），但现实中却住在与之形成巨大落差的房子（第5段）。综合文意，"事情的发展"指的是住好房子的希望成空，因此最后一句中的 But指出了 "我" 不相信父母的话，不相信住在芒果街上的这间小房子里只是暂时的，也就是说，"我"觉得不可能得到梦想中的房子，故可答Their dream house is only a dream或They can't own the house they dream of。

------

#### PASSAGE TWO

1. **The participants who didn't receive help. // The participants who didn't get help.**

- **解析**: 根据题干直接定位到第5段。该段第1句提到德斯迪诺及其团队的研究发现，总体上，在第一次测试中得到陌生人帮助的研究参与者在下一次测试中更愿意合作。括号中的内容对此作进一步解释，其中those who'd received help与their counterparts是比较对象，故 counterparts指的是The participants who didn't receive/ get help。

1. **The participants who didn't receive help. // The participants who didn't get help.**

- **解析**: 根据题干直接定位到第10段。该段第1句提到，阿尔戈的团队让每个伴侣想出另一半最近为自己做过的事情，不管事情大小，然后向他或她表示感谢。做这项任务之前，这些夫妻先要完成一份关于夫妻关系满意度的调查。六个月后，再做一次同样的调查。第2句提到，研究中得到伴侣感谢的男女对夫妻关系感到更满意。由此可知，their counterparts指的是The participants who didn't receive/ get help。

------

#### PASSAGE THREE

1. **Skeptical. // Sceptical.**

- **解析**: 根据题干直接定位到最后一段最后一句。最后一段提到，作家艾伦・帕特里克・赫伯特为新词设计了一个评分体系；倒数第2句提到，作者最近很喜欢的一个词叫bouncebackability，但也同时提到，television在这个体系里也不过是刚刚及格，所以作者担心bouncebackability会过不了测试（I fear it would fail the test）。可见，作者说这句话时暗含了对该评分体系的怀疑，认为这个评分体系并不可靠，故答 Skeptical/Sceptical。

#### How to Raise People's Awareness of Environmental Protection

New findings have reported that plastic bags pose great harm to our environment, polluting the soil and water during their slow process of decomposition. Meanwhile, littered plastic threatens the health of wildlife, leading to their breathing and digestion problems, and producing plastic also consumes lots of energy derived from fossil fuel. Now banning plastic shopping bags becomes a trend and many environmental groups are pushing for more bans.

In my opinion, it's highly necessary to stop using plastic bags to protect our environment. But the problem is how to raise people's awareness of environmental protection. To achieve this, some measures need to be taken.

First, strengthen publicity. We can make full use of social media like Internet, TV, broadcast, and newspaper where we can, for example, publicize videos, photos, articles that reveal the serious environmental damage plastic bags have done. At the same time, short video clips and banners about the negative influence of plastic bags can be made and shown in public places like shopping plazas, transports, elevators and roadsides so as to draw people's attention. Additionally, strengthen school education. This can be integrated into the curriculum to make students fully aware of the worsening of our environment and the urgency of protecting our environment.

In all, joint efforts need to be made to reduce the impact of environmental pollution and protect the environment we live in.

Why has the McDonald's model proven so irresistible? Eating fast food at McDonald's has certainly become a "sign" that, among other things, one is in tune with the contemporary lifestyle. There's also a kind of magic or **(31) appeal** associated with such food and their settings. However, what will be focused on here are the four alluring dimensions that lie at the **(32) bottom** of the success of this model. In **(33) general**, McDonald's has succeeded because it offers consumers, workers, and managers efficiency, calculability, predictability and control.

One important element of McDonald's success is efficiency, or the optimum **(34) method** for getting from one point to another. For consumers, McDonald's offers the best available way to get from being hungry to being full. In a society where both parents are likely to work or where a single parent is **(35) struggling** to raise children on her own, efficiently satisfying hunger is very attractive.

Calculability is an emphasis on the quantitative aspects of products sold (portion size, cost) and services offered (the time it takes to get the product). In McDonaldized systems, quantity has become equivalent to quality; a lot of something, or the quick **(36) delivery** of it, means it must be good.

McDonald's also offers predictability, the **(37) assurance** that products and services will be the same over time and in all locales. The Egg McMuffin in New York will be **(38) identical** to those in Chicago and Los Angeles. Also, those eaten next week or next year will be the same as those eaten today.

The fourth element in McDonald's success, control, is **(39) exerted** over people who enter the world of McDonald's. Lines, limited menus, **(40) few** options all lead diners to do what management wishes them to do—eat quickly and leave.

### 2022 年英语专业四级真题补充卷详解

------

#### PART III: LANGUAGE USAGE

1. **D. Should... have**

- **解析**: 考查虚拟条件句的倒装用法。条件状语从句中，含有 were、had或should等词时，可将if省去，并把were、had或should等提到主语之前，引起倒装。题中假设的是一种将来的情况。should在句中有 "万一，假如" 的意思，表示对将来的假设，故选D项。A、C项均错在不该使用had，正常语序应该用一般现在时，即have。真实条件句不用have done结构，故B项错误。

1. **C. too much of a coward**

- **解析**: 考查名词用法。C项中的much of a/an + sth./sb.相当于形容词，即much of a coward相当于cowardly，且选项中的 too 与空格后的 to 搭配，构成too... to...结构，故将C项填人文中相当于 Unfortunately, she was too cowardly to tell..., 语法结构及语义均正确。A项语法结构正确，但填人文中意为 "她是个真正的懦夫，甚至把真相告诉了她最亲密的朋友"，语义不通，应改为类似enough of a man 的表达。B项中的 too much后应接不可数名词。D项与A项类似，填人文中意为 "她足够懦弱到把真相告诉了她最亲密的朋友"，应改为 man enough之类的表达；此外，此处单数可数名词（a coward）含义抽象化具有形容词意味时，要当作不可数用，语法上也应用coward enough。

1. **A. so**

- **解析**: 考查固定搭配。not so much... as... 表示 "与其说是 ⋯⋯⋯⋯ 不如说是 ⋯⋯⋯⋯ "。故选 A项，其他选项均不能和题中的 not... much搭配。

1. **B. How strange feelings they are!**

- **解析**: 考查感叹句的构成。感叹句主要有两种： what +（a/an + adj.）+ n.（+ 主语 + 谓语 + 其他成分）； how + adj./adv. ( + 主语 + 谓语)。除此，口语中还可以用陈述句、祈使句、疑问句表达感叹，也可以用 how dare/dared（+ 主语 + 谓语）结构。A、C、D项符合感叹句的构成，而B项中的 How 后不能接名词词组 strange feelings，应改成 "What strange feelings they are!"。

1. **C. bid**

- **解析**: 考查词义辨析。C项 bid表示 "投标，出价"，后接介词 for，与 take-over（收购，接管）搭配合理，故选 C项。A项 application 表示 "申请（书）"，虽然能与 for 搭配，但要收购一家公司，需要的不是 "申请 （书"，A项不如C项切合语境。B项 merge 表示 "合并"，与 with 搭配。D项auction 表示 "拍卖，拍卖会"，与 take-over的语义搭配不合理。

1. **C. restoring**

- **解析**: 考查近义词辨析。A项 recover和C项 restore都有"恢复"的意思，但对博物馆的艺术品来说应该用restore（修复，使恢复原貌）描述，该词表示 to clean and repair something old and dirty or damaged so that it looks the same as it did originally。A项 recover表示"恢复健康"或"从不开心或不愉快的经历中恢复过来"，B项 renew表示"更新，替换"，D项 revive表示"复兴，恢复精力"，均与"艺术品"不搭配。

1. **B. involves**

- **解析**: 考查词义辨析。B项 involve表示"涉及，包含"，填人句中语义通顺，故选B项。A项 concern表示"涉及，影响"，取"涉及"之意时应用短语 be concerned with。C项 request表示"要求，请求"，D项 offer 表示 "提供"，均与句意不符。

#### Why Has the McDonald's Model Proven So Irresistible?

Why has the McDonald's model proven so irresistible? Eating fast food at McDonald's has certainly become a "sign" that, among other things, one is in tune with the contemporary lifestyle. There's also a kind of magic or **(31) appeal** associated with such food and their settings. However, what will be focused on here are the four alluring dimensions that lie at the **(32) bottom** of the success of this model. In **(33) general**, McDonald's has succeeded because it offers consumers, workers, and managers efficiency, calculability, predictability and control.

One important element of McDonald's success is efficiency, or the optimum **(34) method** for getting from one point to another. For consumers, McDonald's offers the best available way to get from being hungry to being full. In a society where both parents are likely to work or where a single parent is **(35) struggling** to raise children on her own, efficiently satisfying hunger is very attractive.

Calculability is an emphasis on the quantitative aspects of products sold (portion size, cost) and services offered (the time it takes to get the product). In McDonaldized systems, quantity has become equivalent to quality; a lot of something, or the quick **(36) delivery** of it, means it must be good.

### 解题思路

1. **A. appeal**

- **解析**: 空格前的 or 表示并列，因此空格填入的词应该与 magic"魔力"一样是名词，并且语义类似。词库里的名词中，最符合语境的是 appeal"吸引力，魅力"，填人后表示麦当劳的食物和环境有一种魔力或吸引力。故选A项。

1. **C. bottom**

- **解析**: 空格前的 the 和空格后的 of 表明本空要填名词。at the heart of... 是固定表达，指 "……的核心"，heart 填人句中也符合语境，即麦当劳模式成功的核心。故选C项。at the bottom of..."……的底部" 也是固定表达，但不符合语境。

1. **G. general**

- **解析**: 本空所在句为该段的总结句，指出了麦当劳成功的 4 个因素：efficiency、calculability、predictability 和 control，而本文后四段分别阐述了这 4 个因素。可见，本句归纳概括下文，是下文的总结句。in general"总而言之，简而言之" 符合语境，故选 G 项。in general"通常，大体上"指不关注细节而从整体上得出笼统的结论，不如 in general恰当。

1. **K. method**

- **解析**: the optimum... for提示空格要填名词。空格所在的 the optimum... to another用于解释前面的 efficiency"效率"，该部分的意思是 "从一点到另一点的最佳…‥"，method "方法"填人后最符合语境，表示效率就是从一点到另一点的最佳方法。故选K项。

1. **O. struggling**

- **解析**: 本空要填的词处于 be... to do sth. 的结构中，且要与介词 to 搭配，可以填人形容词、动词的过去分词或现在分词。此处语境是描述单身家长独自养孩子，与双职工家庭类似，这类家长日子不好过（很忙），所以才需要快速填饱肚子。因此， struggle to do sth. "吃力地做某事" 符合语境，故选 struggling，即 O 项。

1. **D. delivery**

- **解析**: 本空要填的词处于 the quick... of it 的结构中，且要与介词 of 搭配，可以填人名词。本句说在麦当劳，数量就等同于质量，东西数量多，或能够做到快速……就意味君质量好。联系日常经验，东西多应该指的是麦当劳的食物数量多，而 "快速"，应该是指其上餐速度，也就是 "递送"给顾客的速度，故 delivery符合语境，选D项。

1. **B. assurance**

- **解析**: the... that... 提示本空要填名词，并且该名词可以被 that 引导的定语从句修饰。空格所在的 the... in all locals 用于解释前面的 predictability"可预测性"，该部分的意思是 " ⋯⋯⋯⋯ 产品和服务在所有时间、所有地区都是一样的"，既然可预测，那就意味君产品和服务都要是一样的，因此麦当劳的可预测性其实就是一种保证，assurance符合语境，故选B项。

1. **I. identical**

- **解析**: 前一句指出，产品和服务在所有时间、所有地区都是一样的(the same)。那么，本句作为例子说明前一句，应该是说纽约的麦满分与芝加哥和洛杉矶的麦满分是完全一样的，identical"完全一样的"符合语境，故选I项。

1. **E. exerted**

- **解析**: 本空要填的词处于 be... over sb. 的结构中，且要与介词 over 搭配，可以填人形容词、动词的过去分词或现在分词。空格所在部分意思是 "控制是……在人身上"，词库中最合适的是 exerted。短语 be exerted over sb.指"施加在某人身上"。故选E项。

1. **F. few**

- **解析**: 空格所在部分包括三个并列的表达：lines"排队的队伍"、limited menus"有限的菜单"和 options"……选择"，这几个因素促使食客快点吃完离开。few options"很少的选择" 与 limited menus 在语义上构成并列，符合语境。故选F项。

### SECTION A: MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

------

#### PASSAGE ONE

1. **A. grew**

- **解析**: 本题问每次搬家后，作者的家庭规模有什么改变。第 1 段倒数第 2 句提到，每次搬家，家里就增加一人 (one more of us)，也就是说，每次搬家后，家庭规模会增加，对应 A项"增长"。

1. **C. Quietness.**

- **解析**: 本题问哪一项描述与文中所述梦想中的房子不符。第4段第2-5句描述了梦想中的房子：有真正的楼梯、地下室、至少三个卫生间、大院子(a great big yard), 可以看出房子是大的; 而第5段第2-6句提到

了芒果街上的房子的面积小(It's small), 脸子小(a small yard), 还只有普通的门厅台阶(ordinary hallway stairs)。由此可见，作者对房子的大小、院子、楼梯都进行了比较。文中只有在描述芒果街上的房子时提及了车库（第5段第5句），没有描述梦想中房子的车库，故选A项"车库"。

1. **D. yard.**

- **解析**: 本题问作者在比较梦想中的房子和芒果街上的房子时，没有比较哪个细节。第4段第3-5句提到，梦想中的房子有真正的楼梯 (real stairs), 地下室、至少三个卫生间、大院子(a great big yard), 可以看出房子是大的; 而第5段第2-6句提到

了芒果街上的房子的面积小(It's small), 脸子小(a small yard), 还只有普通的门厅台阶(ordinary hallway stairs)。由此可见，作者对房子的大小、院子、楼梯都进行了比较。文中只有在描述芒果街上的房子时提及了车库（第5段第5句），没有描述梦想中房子的车库，故选A项"车库"。

#### PASSAGE TWO

1. **B. It can direct one's future behavior.**

- **解析**: 本题问德斯迪诺教授对感恩的看法。第3段最后一句概括了德斯迪诺的研究角度：感恩对人们行为的影响。第3段最后一句提到，感恩指导我们未来的行为(direct our behavior in the future)。B项中 direct复现原文关键词，future behavior是对原文behavior in the future的同义改写，故选B项"它可以指导人们未来的行为"。

1. **A. Better mental well-being.**

- **解析**: 本题问哪一项不属于感恩的潜在好处。第 5 段最后两句提到感恩有助于引导行为，能促使人们多加锻炼，促使人们更加乐于助人（而不仅仅是帮助自己觉得"亏大"的人）。第6段第1句提到感恩与健康存在关联，如血压降低和身体感觉更好。第8段第1句提到感恩似乎能提高自己关心他人的能力。第11段提到研究中得到伴侣感谢的男女对夫妻关系感到更满意。由此可知，A项"更好的心理健康"没有原文依据，故为答案。

1. **C. their research objectives.**

- **解析**: 本题问德斯迪诺和阿尔戈研究的相似之处。第2段最后一句概括了德斯迪诺的研究角度：感恩对人们行为的影响。第10段第1句点明阿尔戈的研究重点：恋爱关系中感恩的影响。两人的研究对象都是gratitude，故选C项"其研究对象"。

1. **A. Effects of gratitude.**

- **解析**: 本题问文章的主题。文章第1-5段介绍德斯迪诺及其团队研究感恩对人们行为的影响，第6段提到一些研究发现感恩与健康存在关联，第7～8段讲艾森伯格教授及其同事也在关注感恩的影响，第 9～12段讲阿尔戈的研究重点——恋爱关系中感恩的影响，并得出结论：表达感激有助提高关系满意度。全文围绕感恩的影响展开，由此可知，A项"感恩的影响"是文章的主题。

------

#### PASSAGE THREE

1. **B. Mixture.**

- **解析**: 本题问 mashup 是什么意思。第 2 段第 1 句是该段的主题句，说明英语是一个词汇大杂烩，随后列举了英语词汇的各种来源。可见，a mashup of words指英语是一个词汇大杂烩，选项中与 mashup 意思最相近的是 mixture"混合体"，故选B项。

1. **D. Changes in word meaning.**

- **解析**: 本题问第 3.4 段的共同主题。第 3 段第 2 句指出，在人们的记忆中，有些词汇的意思完全改变了，而有些词汇经过一番大改后，又变了回来；第4段第2句指出，现在使用的许多词的意思与以前都不一样。随后举例说明某些词义的转变，包括一些俚语，以及nice、sad等词。因此，D项"词义的变化"为正确答案。

1. **C. medicine.**

- **解析**: 本题问哪项不是新词诞生的领域。第5.6段讲述多个领域的词汇来源。第5段前两句提到作家莎士比亚和弥尔顿；第3句提到心理学家荣格和弗洛伊德；第6段讲述了一些科技新词的创造过程。可见，只有 C 项"医学领域"没有在第 5.6 段提及，故选 C 项。

### SECTION B: SHORT ANSWER QUESTIONS

------

#### PASSAGE ONE

1. **It was too old to live in.**

- **解析**: 根据题干要求直接定位到第3段。本题问根据第3段的描述，可以对叙述者在鲁米斯街上的公寓作出什么样的推断。第3段第2句提到，鲁米斯街上的公寓水管破了，但房东却不肯修理，只因房子太过老旧，导致一家人需要靠借邻居的水过活（第3段第4句）。由此可推断，该房子过于老旧不适宜居住，故可答It was too old to live in。

1. **Their dream house is only a dream. // They can't own the house they dream of.**

- **解析**: 根据题干要求直接定位到第11段。"我"的父母都说现在住在芒果街上的这间小房子里只是暂时的（For the time being、Temporary），言下之意是，"我们"还是有可能住上梦想中的房子的。但此时 "我"话锋一转，指出 "我知道这些事情最后都会怎样"，那事情究竟会怎么样呢？文中的"我"其实深有体会：父母描绘着梦想中的房子（第4段），但现实中却住在与之形成巨大落差的房子（第5段）。综合文意，"事情的发展"指的是住好房子的希望成空，因此最后一句中的 But指出了 "我" 不相信父母的话，不相信住在芒果街上的这间小房子里只是暂时的，也就是说，"我"觉得不可能得到梦想中的房子，故可答Their dream house is only a dream或They can't own the house they dream of。

#### PASSAGE TWO

1. **The participants who didn't receive help. // The participants who didn't get help.**

- **解析**: 根据题干直接定位到第5段。该段第1句提到德斯迪诺及其团队的研究发现，总体上，在第一次测试中得到陌生人帮助的研究参与者在下一次测试中更愿意合作。括号中的内容对此作进一步解释，其中those who'd received help与their counterparts是比较对象，故 counterparts指的是The participants who didn't receive/ get help。

1. **The participants who didn't receive help. // The participants who didn't get help.**

- **解析**: 根据题干直接定位到第10段。该段第1句提到，阿尔戈的团队让每个伴侣想出另一半最近为自己做过的事情，不管事情大小，然后向他或她表示感谢。做这项任务之前，这些夫妻先要完成一份关于夫妻关系满意度的调查。六个月后，再做一次同样的调查。第2句提到，研究中得到伴侣感谢的男女对夫妻关系感到更满意。由此可知，their counterparts指的是The participants who didn't receive/ get help。

------

#### PASSAGE THREE

1. **Skeptical. // Sceptical.**

- **解析**: 根据题干直接定位到最后一段最后一句。最后一段提到，作家艾伦・帕特里克・赫伯特为新词设计了一个评分体系；倒数第2句提到，作者最近很喜欢的一个词叫bouncebackability，但也同时提到，television在这个体系里也不过是刚刚及格，所以作者担心bouncebackability会过不了测试（I fear it would fail the test）。可见，作者说这句话时暗含了对该评分体系的怀疑，认为这个评分体系并不可靠，故答 Skeptical/Sceptical。

#### How to Raise People's Awareness of Environmental Protection

New findings have reported that plastic bags pose great harm to our environment, polluting the soil and water during their slow process of decomposition. Meanwhile, littered plastic threatens the health of wildlife, leading to their breathing and digestion problems, and producing plastic also consumes lots of energy derived from fossil fuel. Now banning plastic shopping bags becomes a trend and many environmental groups are pushing for more bans.

In my opinion, it's highly necessary to stop using plastic bags to protect our environment. But the problem is how to raise people's awareness of environmental protection. To achieve this, some measures need to be taken.

First, strengthen publicity. We can make full use of social media like Internet, TV, broadcast, and newspaper where we can, for example, publicize videos, photos, articles that reveal the serious environmental damage plastic bags have done. At the same time, short video clips and banners about the negative influence of plastic bags can be made and shown in public places like shopping plazas, transports, elevators and roadsides so as to draw people's attention. Additionally, strengthen school education. This can be integrated into the curriculum to make students fully aware of the worsening of our environment and the urgency of protecting our environment.

In all, joint efforts need to be made to reduce the impact of environmental pollution and protect the environment we live in.

#### Loneliness and Wisdom: Are They Related?

Rising rates of loneliness may not be news, but the three periods when it peaks may come as a surprise: More people reported feeling moderate to severe loneliness during their late 20s, their mid-50s and their late 80s than in other life periods, according to the research published in the journal *International Psychogeriatrics*.

The general sense of isolation was also more prevalent than the researchers had expected. A full three-quarters of the study participants reported moderate to high levels of loneliness, said Dr. Philip Jeste, senior author of the study and a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego. "One thing to remember is that loneliness is subjective. Loneliness does not mean being alone; loneliness does not mean not having friends," said Dr. Jeste, who is also director at the UC San Diego's Center for Healthy Aging, "Loneliness is defined as 'subjective distress.' It is the discrepancy between the social relationships you want and the social relationships you have, he said.

Within the dark clouds, Dr. Jeste also found a silver lining: An inverse relationship exists between loneliness and wisdom. "In other words, people who have high levels of wisdom didn't feel lonely, and vice versa," he said.

Edward Hopper (1882-1967) is something of a success, if only his success had come swifter. At the age of 40, he was a failing artist who \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (31) to sell a single painting. As he approached 80, Time magazine \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (32) him on its cover. Today, half a century after his death, Hopper is considered a giant of modern expression, with an uncanny, unforgettable, and utterly \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (33) sense for mood and place.

Much of Hopper's work excavates modern city experience. In canvas \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (34) canvas, he depicts diners, cafes, streetlights, gas stations, train stations, and hotel rooms. The scenes are marked by vivid color juxtapositions and stark, theatrical lighting, as well as by harshly contoured figures, who appear at once part of, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (35) to, their surroundings. The ambiance throughout his repertoire is of loneliness, and psychological tension, whereas his rural or coastal scenes offer a strong \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (36) of tranquility or optimism.

Realistic \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (37) they may seem, Edward Hopper's paintings are not mere representations of supposed reality. They deconstruct and reconstruct the real, transforming it beyond the purely experiential. Like the views Hopper regularly included as pictures within his pictures, a characteristic Hopper composition is not first and foremost an image of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (38) fact but rather a gestalt created out of breakdown and fracture in the process of perception and indeed the capacity to perceive. His works have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (39) been dubbed metaphors of silence. Just as all utterance is governed by what remains unsaid, and by silence, so too Hopper's art has its center of gravity in what is not actually visible in the paintings. Hopper's art enacts ways of seeing and understanding that anchor \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (40) situations in profound depths.

### SECTION A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) Pairing the words "baby" and "sleep" can evoke strong emotions. Those who have had limited contact with little ones might interpret this word-combination as implying deep and prolonged slumber. For others, this union of words may elicit memories of prolonged periods of chaotic sleep (or what can feel like no sleep at all).

(2) Coping with the way babies sleep can be difficult. It's not that babies don't sleep. In fact, they sleep more than at any other stage of life. It's more an issue of when they sleep. Newborns start by sleeping and waking around the clock. This is not always easy for parents. There is even research suggesting that in adults waking repeatedly at night can feel as bad as getting hardly any sleep in terms of attentional skills, fatigue levels and symptoms of depression.

(3) As to why infants wake at night, this is best explained by thinking about the two things that govern our sleep: the homeostatic and circadian processes. The crux of the homeostatic process is the straightforward idea that the longer we have been awake the greater our sleep drive (and the more sleepy we feel). It may take an adult an entire day to build up enough sleep drive to fall asleep at bedtime, but an infant may only need an hour or two of wakefulness before being able to drift off to sleep.

(4) The second process is circadian, which works like a clock. Adults typically feel more awake during the morning hours and sleepy at night, regardless of when we last slept. In very young babies this process is not yet developed. This means that sleep is more likely to occur at different points across the 24-hour day.

(5) Practically speaking, the immaturity of these two processes means that newborn babies are actually expected to wake at night: they are doing exactly what they are supposed to do! They start life with small stomachs which need to be filled regularly so your child can gain strength and stay hydrated, so it's a good thing that they are waking regularly to feed. As hard as disturbed sleep can be for caregivers, a waking baby is a good thing.

(6) But how long might this continue? The parenting mantra "this too shall pass" is true when it comes to dealing with certain aspects of a baby's sleep. Night wakings typically become less frequent as an infant grows up, and sleep changes in other ways throughout a person's life. For example, sleep length reduces and there are changes in sleep architecture (or composition of Rapid Eye Movement, REM, and Non-Rapid Eye Movement, NREM, sleep). A premature baby's sleep cycle might take just 45 minutes, whereas an adult's can be double that at 90 minutes. Other changes also occur; for example, whereas babies' sleep cycles start with REM-like sleep, adults start with NREM sleep.

(7) For some parents, knowing that sleep changes throughout life is enough to help them cope with an infant's night awakenings. In fact, sleep education alone can help some parents to deal with infant sleep. Other parents want more detailed information, such as about babies' sleep schedules, bedtime routines, sleep problems, sleep safety, sleep environment, naps, sleep training, and special circumstances. We provide all this information, and more, on our website, where physicians, psychologists, and researchers from the Pediatric Sleep Council have also answered hundreds of questions about sleep via video and text.

(8) Remember: sleep matters. Experts agree that sleep is essential for health, growth and general development. It is important not just for babies, but for parents too. If we can improve sleep within a family, and create a happy association between the words "baby" and "sleep", then the Pediatric Sleep Council has achieved its goal.

41. According to the passage, the difficulty in handling baby sleep lies in not knowing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
A. when they switch to slumber
B. how long they sleep well
C. how they fall asleep
D. when they sleep

42. In explaining the circadian process, the author has used \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ more than other means.
A. simile
B. comparison
C. metaphor
D. exaggeration

43. Which of the following statements is CORRECT about baby sleep?
A. Parents need to be well informed about baby sleep.
B. Babies' sleep cycle tends to be similar to that of adults.
C. A happy link between "baby" and "sleep" is impossible.
D. Babies sleep a lot more during daytime than nighttime.

44. Which of the following is the most appropriate title for the passage?
A. Secrets of parenting babies.
B. Baby sleep patterns.
C. Does baby sleep matter?
D. What are the must-knows of sleep?

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) Roie Galitz's adventurous spirit has quite literally driven him to the ends of the Earth. He has made several excursions to the Arctic islands of Svalbard and the ice sheets of Antarctica. He has also been to the snowy plain of Norway and the wild waters of Kamchatka, Russia-all in the hopes of capturing some of the Earth's most elusive creatures.

(2) The photographer comes from Tel Aviv, Israel. He first fell in love with wildlife photography in the sweltering savannas of Tanzania, Africa. Galitz says he prefers to work in the cold-even when that can mean temperatures as low as 40 degrees below zero. He layers up multiple pairs of long trousers, fleece shirts and the thickest wool socks he can find. On top of all of that, he wears an 8-pound Arctic suit. "When you're cold, you can always put on an extra layer," he says. "But when you're hot, there is a legal limit to how much you can remove."

(3) Extreme environments are also where he finds his favorite photography subjects: animals that are rarely viewed in the wild.

(4) "If I showed things that have been viewed time and time again, it wouldn't be special. It wouldn't be unique," Galitz says. "It would just be like photographing a sparrow. Who cares about a sparrow? Everybody sees them all the time. As a photographer, I always try to find what has been done, what hasn't been done, why it hasn't been done-then try to do it."

(5) One photo that captures Galitz's quest features a polar bear with a live seal in its grasp. This moment of the hunt had rarely, if ever, been photographed before. Local bear experts doubted that Galitz would be able to get the shot. But after a long night of silently kneeling on the ice, fighting to stay warm but remaining still so as not to disturb the seals swimming below-he got the shot.

(6) Venturing into the wild comes with some risk, from frostbite to close encounters with bears and walruses. Galitz takes it all in stride. A minor case of frostbite in the Arctic is like getting a sunburn at the beach, he says. And the cold forces him to be resourceful. On multiple occasions, he has used his nose to operate the touch screen on his camera. Sometimes, though, he will quickly remove his gloves to snap the shot.

(7) Wildlife photography requires a certain spirit, Galitz says. For many of the far-off places he chooses to shoot, he has to obtain production permits and coordinate the often-complicated logistics of getting there. But the planning pays off, he says, when he gets the perfect shot. In a photo titled "Polar Bear Family Hug", he captured two cubs and a mother bear in a moment of vulnerability as they awoke from a nap.

(8) "That's actually the best compliment a wildlife photographer can ask for," Galitz says. "Because when an animal is sleeping in front of you, it means she trusts you."

(9) In another photo of brown bears playing together in Lake Kuril in Russia, Galitz laid low to the ground and took shot after shot. He was trying to capture the symmetry of the bears' open mouths. "With wildlife, you control the scene by controlling yourself," he says, referring to his position in relation to his furry subjects. You can't tell a bear to strike a pose or turn toward the light. So for a wildlife photographer, Galitz explains, it's all about the technique.

(10) In addition to stunning action shots, Galitz also looks to capture moments that will elicit specific feelings from the viewer. "When I'm photographing the animals, I'm trying to show their character, their soul," he says. Many of his photos depict animals in moments of closeness-courting, parenting, cuddling-to demonstrate their individual personalities and familial relationships. "I'm trying to make people relate to animals in an intimate way, as I am relating to animals in an intimate way," he says.

(11) Galitz also regularly uses his photography to promote conservation efforts. Looking at his photos from year to year, he says he can see the world changing and the habitats of the animals he photographs disappearing. "My images are testimony," he says. "This is what I saw last year, this is what I saw here, you can see the difference. We can't ignore that."

45. Which of the following statements is CORRECT about Galitz?
A. He likes to photograph animals of different species.
B. He prefers to photograph in remote regions on Earth.
C. He takes a strong interest in extreme environments.
D. He loves to photograph rare animals in the cold.

46. Which of the following is NOT mentioned as a requirement for a wildlife photographer?

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) It was a big, squarish frame house that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies, set on what had once been our most select street. But garages and cotton gins had encroached and obliterated even the names of that neighborhood; only Miss Emily's house was left, lifting its stubborn and coquettish decay above the cotton wagons and the gasoline pumps-an eyesore among eyesores.

(2) Alive, Miss Emily had been a tradition, a duty, and a care; a sort of hereditary obligation upon the town, dating from that day in 1894 when Colonel Sartoris, the mayor-he who fathered the edict that no Negro woman should appear on the streets without an apron-remitted her taxes, the dispensation dating from the death of her father on into perpetuity. Not that Miss Emily would have accepted charity. Colonel Sartoris invented an involved tale to the effect that Miss Emily's father had loaned money to the town, which the town, as a matter of business, preferred this way of repaying. Only a man of Colonel Sartoris' generation and thought could have invented it, and only a woman could have believed it.

(3) When the next generation, with its more modern ideas, became mayors and aldermen, this arrangement created some little dissatisfaction. On the first of the year they mailed her a tax notice. February came, and there was no reply. They wrote her a formal letter, asking her to call at the sheriff's office at her convenience. A week later the mayor wrote her himself, offering to call or to send his car for her, and received in reply a note on paper of an archaic shape, in a thin, flowing calligraphy in faded ink, to the effect that she no longer went out at all. The tax notice was also enclosed, without comment.

(4) They called a special meeting of the Board of Aldermen. A delegation waited upon her, knocked at the door through which no visitor had passed since she ceased giving china-painting lessons eight or ten years earlier. They were admitted by the old Negro into a dim hall from which a stairway mounted into still more shadow. It smelled of dust and disuse-a close, dank smell. The Negro led them into the parlor. It was furnished in heavy, leather-covered furniture. When the Negro opened the blinds of one window, they could see that the leather was cracked; and when they sat down, a faint dust rose sluggishly about their thighs, spinning with slow motes in the single sunray. On a tarnished gilt easel before the fireplace stood a crayon portrait of Miss Emily's father.

(5) They rose when she entered-a small, fat woman in black, with a thin gold chain descending to her waist and vanishing into her belt, leaning on an ebony cane with a tarnished gold head. Her skeleton was small and spare; perhaps that was why what would have been merely plumpness in another was obesity in her. She looked bloated, like a body long submerged in motionless water, and of that pallid hue. Her eyes, lost in the fatty ridges of her face, looked like two small pieces of coal pressed into a lump of dough as they moved from one face to another while the visitors stated their errand.

(6) She did not ask them to sit. She just stood in the door and listened quietly until the spokesman came to a stumbling halt. Then they could hear the invisible watch ticking at the end of the gold chain.

(7) Her voice was dry and cold. "I have no taxes in Jefferson. Colonel Sartoris explained it to me. Perhaps one of you can gain access to the city records and satisfy yourselves."

(8) "But we have. We are the city authorities, Miss Emily. Didn't you get a notice from the sheriff, signed by him?"

(9) "I received a paper, yes," Miss Emily said. "Perhaps he considers himself the sheriff... I have no taxes in Jefferson."

(10) "But there is nothing on the books to show that, you see. We must go by the..."

(11) "See Colonel Sartoris. I have no taxes in Jefferson."

(12) "But, Miss Emily..."

(13) "See Colonel Sartoris. (Colonel Sartoris had been dead almost ten years.) I have no taxes in Jefferson. Tobe!" The Negro appeared. "Show these gentlemen out."

48. Which of the following statements is CORRECT according to Para. 2?
A. Colonel Sartoris promised to pay tax for Miss Emily.
B. Miss Emily would have to pay tax after a few years.
C. Colonel Sartoris exempted Miss Emily's taxes.
D. Miss Emily's father once lent money to the town.

49. Which of the following descriptions matches Miss Emily?
A. Her eyes were small and sunken.
B. She dressed herself elegantly.
C. She was rather thin and weak.
D. Her complexion was healthy.

50. Which of the following best characterizes Miss Emily's personality?
A. Proud and self-centered.
B. Polite and conservative.
C. Stubborn and arrogant.
D. Aggressive and bitter.

**Teacher quality assessment commonly includes reviews of qualifications, tests of teaching quality, and observations of teaching practice. Assessments of teacher quality are currently used for policy making, employment, merit-based pay awards, and as data to inform the professional growth of teachers, etc.**

**Teacher qualifications include a range of variables affecting teacher quality: type of teaching certification, undergraduate major or minor, undergraduate institution, advanced degree(s) or certifications, type of preparation program, test scores, and years of teaching experience. In many countries, teaching credentials represent the main measure of teacher quality and serve as a threshold of holding teaching positions.**

**Teacher quality with regard to student achievement-also known as "teacher effectiveness"-is measured in terms of student achievement gains. Student achievement is measured through the use of standardized tests to determine the academic growth of students over time.**

**Assessments of teacher quality may also draw upon evidence collected from observations of teachers' work that lead to the growth of effective teachers. This evidence may be collected from in-person or video recorded observations of teaching, pre- and post-observation conferences with teachers, and samples of teachers' work with students. Assessments of teacher practice may examine teacher quality for a single lesson or over an entire school year. Such assessments may be impression-based or narrative in form but have become increasingly more common in teacher quality assessment.**

## PART IV CLOZE

Decide which of the words given in the box below would best complete the passage if inserted in the corresponding blank. The words can be used ONCE ONLY. Mark the letter for each word on ANSWER SHEET TWO.

| A. dominating | B. forward | C. gap     | D. habits     | E. himself |
| :------------ | :--------- | :--------- | :------------ | :--------- |
| F. just       | G. lack    | H. obesity | I. only       | J. set     |
| K. setbacks   | L. short   | M. stretch | N. themselves | O. tiny    |

Tiny is mighty, at least when it comes to change. Over the last twenty years, I've found that almost everyone wants to make some kind of change: lose weight, get better sleep, reduce stress. We want to be more productive and creative. But the alarming levels of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (31), sleeplessness, and stress reported by the media tell me there is a painful \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (32) between what people want and what they actually do.

The disconnection between want and do has been blamed on a lot of things - but people blame it on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (33) for the most part. When our results fall \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (34) of our expectations, many of us believe that something must be wrong with us. If \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (35) we were better people, we wouldn't have failed. Right?

NO. It isn't your fault, and creating positive change isn't as hard as you think. For too many years, myths, misconceptions, and well-meaning but unscientific advice have \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (36) you up to fail. If you've attempted change in the past and haven't seen results, you may have concluded that change is hard or that you can't succeed because you \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (37) motivation. Neither is accurate. The problem is with the approach itself, not with you.

Building \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (38) and creating positive changes can be easy - if you have the right approach. In order to design successful habits and change your behaviors, the following three methods should be adopted in the very beginning. First, stop judging yourself. Second, take your aspirations and break them down into \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (39) behaviors. Third, embrace mistakes as discoveries and use them to move \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (40).

#### PASSAGE ONE

(1) Downturn's new spending habits show the way to greater satisfaction.
(2) As the months passed, out went stacks of sweaters, shoes, pots and pans, even the television after a trial separation during which it was relegated to a closet. Eventually, Tammy Strobel and her husband Logan Smith, both 31, got rid of their cars, too. Her mother called her crazy. Today, three years after the couple began downsizing, they live in a studio with a nice-sized kitchen. They have money to travel and to contribute to the education funds of nieces and nephews. Because their debt is paid off, Ms. Strobel works fewer hours, giving her time to be outdoors and to volunteer. "The idea that you need to go bigger to be happy is false," she says. "I really believe that the acquisition of material goods doesn't bring about happiness."
(3) While Ms. Strobel and her husband overhauled their spending habits before the recession, legions of other consumers have since had to adapt in ways that could ultimately make them happier.
(4) New studies of consumption and happiness show, for instance, that people are happier when they spend money on experiences instead of material objects.
(5) While the current round of stinginess may simply be a response to the economic downturn, some analysts say consumers may also be permanently adjusting their spending based on what they've discovered about what truly makes them happy or fulfilled.
(6) "This actually is a topic that hasn't been researched very much until recently," says Elizabeth Dunn, a psychology professor, who is at the forefront of research on consumption and happiness. "There's massive literature on income and happiness. It's amazing how little there is on how to spend your money."
(7) Studies over the last few decades have shown that money, up to a certain point, makes people happier because it lets them meet basic needs. The latest round of research is all about emotional efficiency: how to reap the most happiness for your dollar.
(8) One major finding is that spending money for an experience - concert tickets, language lessons, dumpling-making classes - produces longer-lasting satisfaction than spending money on plain old stuff. "It's better to go on a vacation than buy a new couch' is basically the idea," says Professor Dunn. Jennifer Black, president of the retailing research company Jennifer Black & Associates, said: "I think people are realizing they don't need what they had. They're more interested in creating memories."
(9) Unlike consumption of material goods, spending on leisure and services typically strengthens social bonds, which in turn helps amplify happiness, research suggests. Paying for experiences also gives us longer-lasting happiness, because we can reminisce about them, researchers says. That's true for even the most exasperating of experiences. That trip to Rome during which you waited in endless lines, broke your camera and argued with your spouse will typically be airbrushed with "rosy recollection", says Professor Dunn. "Trips aren't all perfect, but we remember them as perfect."
(10) And experiences can't be absorbed at once - it takes more time to adapt to them and engage with them than it does to put on a new leather jacket or turn on that shiny flat-screen TV. "We buy a new house, we get accustomed to it," says Professor Lyubomirsky, who studies what psychologists call "hedonic adaptation", a phenomenon in which people quickly become used to changes, great or terrible, in order to maintain a stable level of happiness. "We stop getting pleasure from it," she says. And then, of course, we buy new things. Scholars have discovered that one way consumers combat hedonic adaptation is to buy many small pleasures instead of one big one. Instead of a new Jaguar, Professor Lyubomirsky advises, buy a massage once a week, have lots of fresh flowers delivered and make phone calls to friends overseas. Instead of a two-week long vacation, take a few three-day weekends. "We do adapt to the little things," she says, "but because there's so many, it will take longer."
(11) Ms. Strobel now writes about her own life choices on the Internet. "My lifestyle now would not be possible if I still had a huge two-bedroom apartment filled with stuff, two cars, and 30 grand in debt," she says. "Give away some of your stuff. See how it feels."

41. What is the main reason for the change in people's spending habits?
A. Pressure to pay off debts.
B. Interest in traveling.
C. Economic downturn.
D. Plan to work from home.

42. Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage?
A. A somewhat imperfect trip can leave long-lasting happiness.
B. A new couch can give people long-lasting happiness.
C. Buying material goods helps prolong people's happiness.
D. Spending money on experiences undermines people's happiness.

43. What is the best title for the passage?
A. Efficiency and Satisfaction.
B. Spending and Happiness.
C. Traveling and Happiness.
D. Experience and Memory.

#### PASSAGE TWO

(1) The five o'clock dads can only be seen on cable television these days. They eat dinner with their television families and provide counsel afterward in the den, exemplifying how men behave when they work eight hours a day.
(2) The five o'clock dad has become an endangered species. A corporate culture that believes presence is productivity, in which people of ambition are afraid to be seen leaving the office, has lengthened his workday and shortened his home life. So has an economy that makes it difficult for families to take a break even at the end of the month. For the man who is paid by the hour, that means never saying no to overtime. For the man whose loyalty to the organization is measured in time at his desk, it means goodbye to nine to five.
(3) To lots of small children it means a visiting father. The standard joke in one large corporate office is that the dads always say their children look like angels when they're sleeping because that's the only way they ever see them. A survey taken several years ago showed that roughly 12 percent of the men surveyed with children under the age of six worked more than sixty hours a week, and an additional 25 percent worked between fifty and sixty hours.
(4) No matter how you divide it up, those are twelve-hour days. When a talk show host adopted a baby recently, she said one reason she was not troubled by becoming a mother without becoming a wife was that many of her married female friends were "functionally single", given the hours their husbands worked. The evening commuter rush is getting longer. The eight o'clock dad. The nine o'clock dad.
(5) There's a horribly sad irony to this, that is, the quality of fathering is better than it was when the dads left work at five o'clock and came home to coffee pots and tuna casserole. The five o'clock dad was remote, a "wait till your father gets home" kind of dad with a newspaper for a face. The roles he and his wife had were clear: she did nurture and home, he did discipline and money.
(6) The role fathers have carved out for themselves today is a vast improvement, a muddling of those old boundaries. Fathers today do seem to be more emotional with their children, more nurturing, more open. Many say, "My father never told me he loved me" and so they tell their own children all the time that they love them.
(7) There are people who think that this is changing even now. A nonprofit organization advises corporations on how to balance personal and professional obligations and concerns, and its founder says she has noticed a change in the past few years. An increasing number of men have expressed their wishes to spend more time with their kids.
(8) This change can be to the good, not only for women but especially for men, and for kids, too. The stereotypical five o'clock dad belongs in a picture, with his "Ask your mother" and his "Don't be a crybaby." The father who believes hugs and kisses are sex-blind and a dirty diaper requires a change is infinitely preferable. What a joy it would be if he were around more.
(9) "This is the man's half of having it all," said Donald Long, a professor who teaches a course about men's relationships that drew 135 students this year for thirty-five places, "We're trying to do what women want of us, what children want of us, but we're not willing to transform the workplace." In other words, the hearts and minds of today's fathers are definitely in the right place, if only their bodies could be there, too.

44. Which of the following reasons best explains the presence of more eight or nine o'clock dads?
A. Preference for overwork.
B. Belief in productivity.
C. Company bonus and overtime.
D. Corporate culture of overwork.

45. The statement "there's a horribly sad irony" (Para. 5) suggests longer working hours have led to
A. more distant relations
B. change of family roles
C. more intimate relations
D. more time with children

46. From the last sentence of the passage, what can be inferred about today's fathers?
A. They wish to have more family time.
B. They think in the similar way as before.
C. They behave in the same way as before.
D. They can spend more time at home.

#### PASSAGE THREE

(1) When a Southerner took the trouble to pack a trunk and travel twenty miles for a visit, the visit was seldom of shorter duration than a month, usually much longer. Southerners were as enthusiastic visitors as they were hosts, and there was nothing unusual in relatives coming to spend the Christmas holidays and remaining until July. Often when newly married couples went on the usual round of honeymoon visits, they lingered in some pleasant home until the birth of their second child. Frequently elderly aunts and uncles came to Sunday dinner and remained until they were buried years later. Visitors presented no problem, for houses were larger, servants numerous and the feeding of several extra mouths a minor matter in that land of plenty. All ages and sexes went visiting, honeymooners, young mothers showing off new babies, convalescents, the bereaved, girls whose parents were anxious to remove them from the dangers of unwise matches, girls who had reached the danger age without becoming engaged and who, it was hoped, would make suitable matches under the guidance of relatives in other places. Visitors added excitement and variety to the slow-moving Southern life and they were always welcome.
(2) So Scarlett had come to Atlanta with no idea as to how long she would remain. If her visit proved as dull as those in Savannah and Charleston, she would return home in a month. If her stay was pleasant, she would remain indefinitely. But no sooner had she arrived than Aunt Pitty and Melanie began a campaign to induce her to make her home permanently with them. They brought up every possible argument. They wanted her for her own self because they loved her. They were lonely and often frightened at night in the big house, and she was so brave she gave them courage. She was so charming that she cheered them in their sorrow. Now that Charles was dead, her place and her son's place were with his kindred. Besides, half the house now belonged to her, through Charles' will. Last, the Confederacy needed every pair of hands for sewing, knitting, bandage rolling and nursing the wounded.
(3) Charles' Uncle Henry Hamilton, who lived in bachelor state at the Atlanta Hotel near the depot, also talked seriously to her on this subject. Uncle Henry was a short, pot-bellied, irascible old gentleman with a pink face, a shock of long silver hair and an utter lack of patience with feminine timidities and vaporings. It was for the latter reason that he was barely on speaking terms with his sister, Miss Pitty. From childhood, they had been exact opposites in temperament and they had been further estranged by his objections to the manner in which she had reared Charles "Making a damn sissy out of a soldier's son!" Years before, he had so insulted her that now Miss Pitty never spoke of him except in guarded whispers and with so great reticence that a stranger would have thought the honest old lawyer a murderer, at the least. The insult had occurred on a day when Pitty wished to draw five hundred dollars from her estate, of which he was trustee, to invest in a non-existent gold mine. He had refused to permit it and stated heatedly that she had no more sense than a June bug and furthermore it gave him the fidgets to be around her longer than five minutes. Since that day, she only saw him formally, once a month, when Uncle Peter drove her to his office to get the housekeeping money. After these brief visits, Pitty always took to her bed for the rest of the day with tears and smelling salts. Melanie and Charles, who were on excellent terms with their uncle, had frequently offered to relieve her of this ordeal, but Pitty always set her babyish mouth firmly and refused. Henry was her cross and she must bear him. From this, Charles and Melanie could only infer that she took a profound pleasure in this occasional excitement, the only excitement in her sheltered life.
(4) Uncle Henry liked Scarlett immediately because, he said, he could see that for all her silly affectations she had a few grains of sense. He was trustee, not only of Pitty's and Melanie's estates, but also of that left Scarlett by Charles.

### Two indigenous languages are dying out every month

Despite UN efforts to highlight the daily disappearance of mother tongues across the world, the President of the General Assembly (PGA) warned that "challenges persist nonetheless". "Every fortnight, at least one indigenous language vanishes from the face of the earth," spelled out the PGA. "This translates into two extinct indigenous languages each month."

He said it was "equally noteworthy," that 15 per cent of the poorest people on the planet are indigenous.

Indigenous traditions have served as a "dependable means of acquiring knowledge" which can be transmitted across generations, he stated, citing examples of herbal medicine, food processing and settling disputes within communities.

And although linguistic diversity is essential to preserve humanity's common heritage, which is critical to its survival, it is endangered with every language that goes extinct.
"With the death of languages, the indigenous people who speak them lose a significant part of their identity," he lamented.

He urged the world to focus attention on the measures to ensure the survival of those which remain, underscoring that "schools have a major role to play".
"By integrating indigenous languages into their curricula, they would have fulfilled the vital mission of shielding the languages from external damage and internal decline," said the PGA.
